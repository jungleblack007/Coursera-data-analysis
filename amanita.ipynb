FRIESLAND PRO-\\nVINCE: Vlieland, in planted pine forests on coastal dunes, 23 October 1994, C. Bas 8942 (L).\\nCommentary: Amanita concentrica was described from Japan by Oda et al. (2002b). It was then reported from China, India and Thailand (Yang 2005, 2015; Semwal et al. 2007; Thongbai et al. 2016).\\nIn our multi-locus data (Fig. 1b), A. concentrica clus- tered, with low support, with the A. muscaria group, which consists of A. gemmata (Fr.) Bertillon, A. muscaria (L.) Lam., A. regalis (Fr.) Michael, A. persicina (Dav.T. Jenkins) Tulloss & Geml., A. ibotengutake T. Oda, C. Tanaka & Tsuda and A. flavopantherina Yang-Yang Cui  et al. However, the two specimens of A. gemmata from the Netherlands listed above differ from A. concentrica by their grayish yellow to yellowish pilei, volval remnants on the pileus dominantly composed of subradically arranged elements with very abundant to nearly dominant filamen- tous hyphae, volval remnants on the stipe base limbate, basidiospores   [120/6/2]   (9鈥)   9.5鈥12.0   (鈥13.0) 9 (6.0鈥)\\n6.5鈥8.5 (鈥9.0) lm, Q = (1.17鈥) 1.25鈥1.62 (鈥1.77), Qm =\\n1.42 卤 0.13, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and the absence of clamps.\\nThe other species in this group differ morphologically from A. concentrica in the following ways. Amanita\\n \\n\\n \\nmuscaria has a red pileus and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores  (9.0鈥12.5 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm)  (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang and Oberwinkler 1999; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser  2000; Galli 2001; Neville  and\\nPoumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita regalis has an ocher-yellow, ocher-brown to brown pileus covered with floccose to pulverulent, yellowish to yellowish-gray volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores  (9.0鈥11.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a;  Contu\\n2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita persicina has a pastel red to light orange or melon-colored pileus covered with yellowish to tannish, floccose-fibrillose patches, cream lamellae with a pinkish tint, the context of the stipe turns yellowish when cut or bruised and the basidiospores are relatively longer (9.4鈥12.7 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins\\n1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015). Amanita ibotengutake has a yellow-brown pileus, short collar-like volval remnants on the stipe base and broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita flavopantherina has a brown pileus covered with yellow, verrucose volval remnants, collar-like volval rem- nants on the stipe base, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 8.0鈥10.0 lm) and is dominant in subalpine forests with Picea and Abies (see below).\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. concentrica see Yang (2005, 2015).\\n3.\\tAmanita elata (Massee) Corner & Bas, Persoonia 2 (3): 286 (1962).\\nBasionym: Collybia elata Massee, Bull.

The descriptions above were based on the Chinese materials cited here. We also studied four collections from the USA as listed in specimens examined, and the basid- iospores of these specimens were [80/4/4] 6.5鈥8.0 (鈥 10) 9 (5.0鈥) 5.5鈥7.0 (鈥8.0) lm, Q = (1.05鈥) 1.12鈥1.34 (鈥\\n1.4), Qm = 1.22 卤 0.08, often subglobose to broadly ellipsoid, or rarely ellipsoid.\\nOur phylogenetic data (Figs. 1b, S6) indicate that col- lections of A. farinosa from China and the USA form a monophyletic clade within A. sect. Amanita. Since no significant morphological differences were found between the Chinese collections and those from the USA, we treat the Chinese Amanita as A. farinosa.

Furthermore, it is found in subalpine forests dominated by Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. flavopantherina is, with low support, related to A. mus- caria, A. regalis, A. persicina, A. ibotengutake, A. gemmata and A. concentrica. However, these species differ mor- phologically from A. flavopantherina in the following ways. Amanita muscaria, a species described from Europe and also found in northern, northeastern and northwestern China, has a red pileus and relatively narrower basid- iospores     measuring     9.0鈥12.5  9 7.0鈥8.5  lm  (Gilbert\\n1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000;\\nGalli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). The European A. regalis has a brown pileus covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita persicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus, cream lamellae with a pinkish  tint  and  relatively  narrower  basidiospores\\n \\n(9.4鈥12.7 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986;  Tulloss et al. 2015). Amanita ibotengutake has white to grayish volval remnants on the pileus, smaller basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.23鈥1.38, Qm = 1.32 卤\\n0.06), and is found in temperate forests (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015). Specimens of A. gemmata listed under A. concentrica differ from A. concentrica by their grayish yellow to yellowish pilei, volval remnants on the pileus composed primarily of subradically arranged elements with very abundant to nearly dominant filamentous hyphae, narrower basidiospores (9.5鈥12.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm), and absence of clamps. The comparisons between A. concen- trica and A. flavopantherina are given in commentary on A. concentrica.\\nAmanita flavopantherina is easily confused with A. griseopantherina Yang-Yang Cui et al. as they have similar appearance and habitats, and for comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. griseopantherina.\\nA species similar to A. flavopantherina and sharing a basidioma with clamps, also found in Abies forest is A. pakistanica Tulloss et al., but the latter differs by its umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, white, detersile volval remnants, and relatively narrower basid- iospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7.0鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). Our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) suggests that they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita subglobosa Zhu L. Yang and A. pantherina (DC.) Krombh. are also similar to A. flavopantherina in their brown basidiomata. However, A. subglobosa has white volval remnants on the pileus and is dominant in forests of Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower alti- tudes (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina has narrower   basidiospores   and   no   clamps    (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000;\\nWasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).

It is dominant in subalpine forests with Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. griseopantherina is related to A. subglobosa, A. pan- therina, A. pseudopantherina Zhu L. Yang et al. and A. velatipes G. F. Atk. However, A. subglobosa, a species described form southwestern China and also similar to A. griseopantherina in appearance, has a relatively smaller basidioma, and is found in forests dominated by Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower altitudes (Yang  1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina, a species descri- bed from Europe but not found in China, has a relatively lower annulus, narrower basidiospores and no clamps (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita pseudopantherina, a provisional name proposed by Yang (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015) and formally described as a novel species in this study, differs from A. griseopantherina by its relatively pale (brown to yellow-brown) pileus and the absence of clamps. Amanita velatipes, described from North America, can be easily distinguished from A. griseopantherina by its paler pileus covered with white patches, and smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b;\\nJenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita griseopantherina can be easily confused with\\nA.\\tflavopantherina in their similar appearance and habitats. However,  A.  flavopantherina  has  a  darker  brown pileus\\n \\n\\n \\ncovered with yellow volval remnants, a white to yellow context, a relatively lower and yellower annulus with an obviously brown edge, a browner stipe, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (10鈥12 9 8鈥10 lm).\\nAmanita pakistanica is similar to A. griseopantherina in the presence of clamps and Abies hosts. However, A. pakistanica has an umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, detersile volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). In our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita ibotengutake, a species described from Japan and also distributed in northeastern China, is also similar to\\nA. griseopantherina in their brown pileus and the common presence of clamps. However, A. ibotengutake has a rela- tively smaller and slender basidioma, and narrower basid- iospores (8鈥10 9 6鈥7.5 lm) (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015; see below).\\n7.\\tAmanita ibotengutake T.

It was then reported from China and Republic of Korea (Kim et al. 2013b; Yang 2015).\\nOur multi-locus data (Fig. 1b) suggest that A. ibo- tengutake is likely to be related to A. muscaria, A. regalis,\\nA.\\tpersicina, A. flavopantherina, A. gemmata and A. con- centrica. However, these species differ from A. ibotengu- take in the following ways. Amanita muscaria has a red pileus and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (9鈥12.5 9 7鈥8.5 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita regalis has yellow volval remnants on the pileus and relatively broader basidiospores (9鈥11 9 7鈥8 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita per- sicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus covered with yellowish to tannish, floccose-fibrillose patches, cream lamellae with pinkish tint, a stipe whose context turns yellowish when cut or bruised and relatively larger basidiospores (9.4鈥12.7 9 7鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\nFor differences between A. ibotengutake and A. flavopantherina see the commentary on A. flavopantherina. Specimens of A. gemmata from Netherlands listed under A. concentrica differ from A. ibotengutake by their relatively longer basidiospores (9.5鈥12.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm) and the absence of clamps (this study).\\nThe comparisons between A. ibotengutake and A. con- centrica are given in the commentary on A. concentrica.

This species is described from Europe and represents the type species of the genus Amanita (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Jenkins and Petersen 1976; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang\\n2005, 2015). Yang and Oberwinkler (1999) provided a detailed study on the basidiomal development and anatomy of A. muscaria.\\nAmanita muscaria was traditionally treated as a single morphospecies with several varieties (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Wasser 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Geml et al. 2006, 2008) and has been reported as a common, widespread, easily identifiable, ecologically plastic fungus with a wide niche (Coker 1917; Jenkins 1977, 1986; Reid 1980; Thiers 1982; Garrido 1986;\\n \\n\\n \\nReid and Eicker 1991; Ridley 1991; Tulloss et al. 1995; Bhatt et al. 2003; Oda et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; Vargas et al. 2017). However, the studies of Geml et al. (2006) and Geml et al. (2008) indicated that the mor- phospecies A. muscaria represents more than one phylo- genetic species.\\nIn    the    multi-locus    analysis    (ITS ? b-tubu-    lin ? LSU ? ef1-a) of Geml et al. (2008), the morphos- pecies A. muscaria was divided into eight clades with strong inter- and intracontinental phylogeographic struc- ture. In our ITS analysis (Fig. S6), our Chinese specimens, HMJAU 4548, HMJAU 4549, and HKAS 61888, clustered\\nwithin the clade II of Geml et al. (2008), which contained many specimens from Eurasia and Alaska.\\nIn our multi-locus analysis (Fig. 1b), A. muscaria was found to be closely related to A. persicina. However, A. persicina has a relatively paler colored (pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored) pileus covered with pale yellow to yellowish-tan to tan, floccose-fibrillose patches and cream lamellae with a pinkish tint (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\n12.\\tAmanita orientigemmata Zhu L.

It is characterized by its yellowish to yellow pileus covered with white to dirty white, felted, patchy or subpyramidal volval remnants, white to yellow- ish, patchy to verrucose or sometimes appressed-limbate volval remnants on the stipe base, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores and the common presence of clamps.\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis, A. pyriformis clustered within A. orientigemmata as a monophyly with strong statistical support (Fig. S6). We therefore treat A. pyri- formis as a synonym of A. orientigemmata. The presence of cystidia reported in A. pyriformis (Li et al. 2016) should a misinterpretation.\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. orientigemmata see Yang and Doi (1999), and Yang (2005, 2015).\\n13.\\tAmanita parvipantherina Zhu L.

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. pseu- dopantherina was closely related to A. pantherina. How- ever, the European A. pantherina has a robust basidioma, and narrower basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville\\nand Poumarat 2004; this study).\\nIn China, species in Amanita sect. Amanita with brown pileus covered with white, pyramidal, verrucose, conical volval remnants, and shortly limbate volval remnants on the stipe base comparable to A. pseudopantherina include\\nA.\\tparvipantherina, A. subglobosa, and A. subparvipan- therina Zhu L. Yang et al. However, A. parvipantherina has a relatively smaller and slender basidioma, and rela- tively narrower basidiospores (8.5鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm) (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita subglobosa can be distinguished from A. pseudopantherina by its rel- atively darker colored pileus and the common presence of clamps (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita subparvipan- therina possesses narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.0 lm) and more abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the pileus (Ariyawansa et al. 2015; see below).\\nThe North American A. velatipes is somewhat similar to\\nA. pseudopantherina, but the former has a paler yellow pileus covered with warted to patchy volval remnants, and relatively smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b; Jenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\n15.\\tAmanita pseudosychnopyramis Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

It was subsequently reported from China and Malaysia (Yang 2015; Lee 2017).\\nCollections of A. sychnopyramis f. sychnopyramis and\\nA. sychnopyramis f. subannulata split into two subclades within a monophyletic clade based on PTP analysis of our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2). However, when more collections were included, the two subclades were not supported (Figs. 1b, S6), and collections of A. sychnopy- ramis and its varieties clustered within each other as a single monophyletic clade. In addition, the morphological discrepancy between them is limited to the presence of a median annulus in A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata (Hongo  1971;  Imazeki  and   Hongo   1987;   Yang   2005, 2015). Consequently, we maintain the current taxo- nomic ranks for A. sychnopyramis and its varieties in this study.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. sychnopyramis f. sychnopyramis is related to A. elata. However, A. elata differs morphologically in that it has a relatively paler pileus (yellowish-brown) covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants and relatively lar- ger basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 7鈥9 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015).

How- ever, A. elata has a relatively paler pileus (yellowish- brown) covered with floccose to pulverulent volval rem- nants, no annulus and relatively larger basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 7鈥9 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015).\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. gleocys- tidiosa clustered within the monophyletic clade of A. sychnopyramis and because of this, coupled with the presence of the annulus mentioned in Li et al. (2016), led us to treat it as a synonym of A. sychnopyramis f. suban- nulata. The presence  of cystidia in A. gleocystidiosa (Li  et al. 2016) could be a misinterpretation.\\n \\n\\n \\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata see Yang (1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita sect.

Distributed in Southern Hemisphere and asso- ciated with Nothofagus and Eucalyptus.\\nDescription: Basidioma agaricoid or sequestrate (stipi- tate or astipitate). When basidioma agaricoid, pileus applanate with a more or less striate margin; volval rem- nants on pileus present; trama white to yellow; lamellae free, white to yellow; lamellulae truncate; stipe subcylin- dric, stipe base non- or slightly inflated, occasionally obviously inflated; volval remnants on stipe base present; annulus mostly median and small; basidiospores inamy- loid, mostly thin-walled and smooth, occasionally thick- walled and ornamented; clamps present in all parts of basidioma. When basidioma sequestrate, gleba loculate, non- or exposed, locules empty or filled with liquid; stip- itate or astipitate, stipe apex mostly not or occasionally extending to the top of gleba; basidiospores statismosporic, inamyloid, mostly thin-walled and smooth, occasionally thick-walled and ornamented; basidia mostly 4-spored, or rarely 2-spored; sterigmata stout and straight; clamps pre- sent in all parts of basidioma. Currently only known in Southern Hemisphere in forests with Nothofagus, Euca- lyptus, etc.\\nCommentary: To date, there is evidence that eight sequestrate species are members of Amanita, namely A. arenaria (O. K. Mill. & E. Horak) Justo, A. torrendii Justo,\\nA.\\tgrandis (Bougher) Justo, A. inculta (Bougher) Justo, A. pseudoinculta Justo, A. oleosa (Bougher & T. Lebel) Justo,\\nA. grandispora (G. W.

(Miller 1992; Malenc赂on 1995; Bougher 1999; Bougher and Lebel 2002; Tulloss 2009; Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017). Of these sequestrate species, six (A. grandis, A. inculta, A. pseudoinculta, A. oleosa, A. grandispora and A. nouhrae) clustered with four agaricoid species (A. morenoi Raithelh.,\\nA.\\tmuriniflammea Tulloss, A. M. Young & A. E. Wood, A. umbrinella E.-J. Gilbert & Cleland and A. merxmuelleri Bresinsky & Garrido) as a distinct clade with high support\\n \\n(Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017; this study). Fur- thermore, species in this clade can be characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidioma, thick-walled and ornamented, or thin-walled and smooth basidiospores, the presence of clamps and distributions through the Southern Hemisphere in forests with Nothofagus and Eucalyptus. Therefore, we treated this clade as a novel section. Bougher and Lebel (2002) proposed the genus Amarrendia typified by Amarrendia oleosa. Then Justo et al. (2010) treated Amarrendia as a synonym of Amanita located in 鈥樷楢mar- rendia clade鈥欌 without section assignment by molecular data. In our study, we named this section  as  Amanita  sect. Amarrendiae based on the basionym of Amarrendia. Based  on  our  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. 1a,  b),  A. sect. Amarrendiae was sister to A. sect. Amanita.\\nAlthough no species from A. sect. Amarrendiae were found in China, we have studied collections of A. pseu- doinculta and A. umbrinella from Australia and provided morphological descriptions below, together with DNA sequences submitted to NCBI.\\nAmanita pseudoinculta Justo, Mycologia 102(3): 682\\n(2010).\\nFigure 7.\\nBasidioma\\tsequestrate,\\tstipitate.\\tGleba\\tloculate.\\nBasidiospores   (Fig. 7)   [30/2/2]   (11.0鈥)   13.0鈥16.0 9\\n7.5鈥9.5 lm,  Q = (1.47鈥)   1.53鈥1.82,   Qm = 1.67 卤 0.1,\\nellipsoid to elongate, statismosporic, inamyloid, mostly thin to slightly thick-walled (less than 0.5 lm thick).

In our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. pseudoinculta  is  closely  related  to  A.  inculta  in  A. sect. Amarrendiae. However, A. inculta differs from A. pseudoinculta in that its gleba often fragments as the stipe\\n \\n\\nFig. 7 Basidiospores of Amanita pseudoinculta (PERTH 08105731). Bars = 10 lm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nelongates, and it has ellipsoid to subovoid basidiospores (9.0鈥14.0 9 6.0鈥7.0 lm, Q = 1.84) (Bougher 1999; Justo\\net al. 2010).\\nFive other sequestrate species in the Amanitaceae, A. torrendii, A. grandis, A. oleosa, A. grandispora and A. nouhrae, are also comparable to A. pseudoinculta. How- ever, A. torrendii, a species in A. sect. Caesareae, differs from A. pseudoinculta by its narrower basidiospores (12.6鈥16.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm, Q = 2.37) and distribution in southern Europe and northern Africa in association with Pinus,  Larix  and  Quercus  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and Horak 1992; Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandis has a relatively larger pileus (up to 4 cm in diam.) expanding outwards from stipe exposing much of the lower gleba, and a cylindrical stipe with its apex extending through the entire gleba to the top of the pileus (Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita oleosa has an astipitate basidioma, locules in the gleba filled with liquid, and rel- atively broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basid- iospores (12.5鈥15.0 9 9.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = 1.39) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandispora has an astipitate basidioma and broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basidiospores (13.0鈥17.0 9 9.5鈥11.5 lm, Q = 1.43) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita nouhrae has distinctly ornamented, subglobose to deformed basidiospores  (14.0鈥20.0 9 12.5鈥17.5 lm, Q = 1.05鈥1.25), is distributed in northern Patagonia and is associated with Nothofagus antarctica (Truong et al. 2017).\\nAmanita umbrinella E.-J.

In the study of Truong et al. (2017) and in our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), four agaricoid species in A. sect. Amar- rendiae, including A. morenoi, A. muriniflammea, A. umbrinella and A. merxmuelleri, clustered as separated lineages and represented different species. However, their morphological characters are still insufficiently known due to limited material.\\nAmanita sect. Caesareae Singer ex Singer, Acta Inst. Bot. Acad. Sci. USSR, Ser. II, Plant.

For the unique sequestrate and stipitate spe- cies, A. torrendii, basidiospores inamyloid and clamps present. Commentary: This study reports 20 species of Amanita sect. Caesareae from China, including six novel species and 14 known species. Of the known taxa, A. hemibapha var. ochracea was elevated to species rank as A. ochracea. To date, no sequestrate taxa of this section have been reported from China. Previous studies and our multi-locus phylogenetic data indicate that the genus Torrendia is a synonym of A. sect.

FUJIAN PROVINCE: in a broad-leaved forest, 9 August 2013, Nian-Kai Zeng 1397 (HKAS 100495).\\nCommentary: Amanita alboumbelliformis is character- ized by its white basidioma with both its pileus center and annulus cream to yellow, a long-striate pileus margin, globose to subglobose basidiospores (9鈥11 9 9鈥11 lm), the presence of clamps and an association with mixed or broad-leaved trees in subtropical forests.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) sug- gested that A. alboumbelliformis is sister to A. aff. princeps (RET 357-5), which was contributed by Sa麓nchez鈥揜am麓谋rez et al. (2015). Whether A. aff. princeps (RET 357-5)\\n \\nrepresents A. alboumbelliformis or a new taxon needs more collections and further morphological study.\\nMorphologically, A. alboumbelliformis is similar to A. chepangiana in their white to cream basidiomata. How- ever, A. chepangiana has relatively shorter striations on pileal margin ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R, a fragile, white annulus and subglobose  to  broadly  ellipsoid   basidiospores   (9.5鈥12.5  9 8.5鈥11.5 lm,  Q  = 1.07鈥1.28,   Qm  = 1.17 卤\\n0.06) (Tulloss and Bhandary 1992; Yang 2000; this study). The European A. caesarea f. alba (Gillet) E. J. Gilbert is also comparable to A. alboumbelliformis, but the former has a thicker pileus with shorter striations on its margin, a shorter and thicker stipe, and narrower and longer basid- iospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Galli 2001; Neville\\nand Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita egregia D. A. Reid and A. loosei Beeli are also similar to A. alboumbelliformis. However, A. egregia dif- fers from A. alboumbelliformis by the relatively larger basidioma with pileus that is ca. 10鈥20 cm in diam., and its open eucalypt forest habitat (Reid 1978, 1980). Amanita loosei has relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin, a pure white annulus and relatively longer basidiospores (Gilbert 1940; Walleyn and Verbeken 1998).\\n27.\\tAmanita caesareoides Lj.

We also studied a collection of A. caesareoides from Russia, VLAM-3904.

Unfortu- nately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from it. Amanita caesareoides is phylogenetically closely rela- ted and morphologically similar to the European A. cae- sarea (Fig. 1b). Examination of European specimens of A. caesarea has revealed that Amanita caesarea can be dis- tinguished from A. caesareoides by its non-umbonate pileus with relatively shorter striations on its margin, a short, robust stipe and larger basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

In our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), A. esculenta was found to be related to A. hunanensis Y. B. Peng & L. J. Liu, A. yua- niana Zhu L. Yang and A. spreta (Peck) Sacc. However, these species can be distinguished from A. esculenta through   the   following   characters.   A.   hunanensis  and\\nA. yuaniana both have a pileus with distinct innate spots or speckles  (Peng  and  Liu  1981;  Yang  1994,   1997,  2005, 2015; Yang and Zhang 2002). Amanita spreta, described from the USA, differs from A. esculenta by its relatively paler colored pileus (whitish or pale brown) and narrower,   elongate   to   cylindric   basidiospores  (Murrill\\n \\n1913; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).

However, the latter can be distinguished by its orange to orange-yellow umbonate pileus, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.25鈥0.35 R) and an orange-yellow annulus.\\nAmanita fuscoflava is also macroscopically similar to A. similis Boedijn, A. malayensis Tang et al. and A. aporema Boedijn. However, A. similis has a yellow stipe covered with pinkish orange squamules and a pinkish orange to grayish annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Amanita malayensis has a yellow pileus with its center often yellowish orange, maize yellow or saffron yellow, shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.3鈥0.4 R), whitish lamellae, and slightly larger basid- iospores (9.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Tang et al. 2018).

Our multi-locus phy- logenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. hunanensis is closely related to A. yuaniana.

AOMORI-KEN: Hakkoda-san, altitude unknown, August 1953, S. Toki (TYPE, TF 3355).\\nCommentary: Yang (1997) described A. incarnatifolia to replace the name A. rhodophylla Imazeki & Toki, and the basidiospores from the type of this species are [120/4/1] (10.5鈥) 11.0鈥14.0 (鈥16.5) 9 (7.5鈥) 8.0鈥9.5 (鈥10.5) lm,\\nQ = (1.22鈥) 1.3鈥1.56 (鈥1.69). Yang (2015) then recorded the collection of HKAS 43098 as A. incarnatifolia. In this study, we follow Yang鈥檚 treatment and consider the monophyletic clade, which contains the collection of HKAS 43098, as A. incarnatifolia.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita incarnatifolia is phylogenetically related and morphologically similar to A. longistriata S. Imai, A. ris- tichii Tulloss, A. virginiana (Murrill) Sacc. & Trotter and\\nA. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b). However, A. longistriata has relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, relatively wider        basidiospores         (10.0鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = (1.22鈥) 1.11鈥1.3, Qm = 1.21 卤 0.08) and is dominant in pine forests (Imai 1938; Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Hongo 1959; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus, relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, white to off-white lamellae and relatively wider basid- iospores (12.5鈥13.3 9 9.4鈥11.7 lm, Q = 1.11鈥1.45) (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993). Because morphological dif- ferences between A. longistriata and A. cf. incarnatifolia (specimens examined listed under A. longistriata) are subtle, more collections are necessary before a formal description of A. cf. incarnatifolia is made. In addition, our multi-locus phylogenetic data indicate that HKAS 29519, treated as A. incarnatifolia in Yang (2005), should be transferred to A. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b).\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. incarnatifolia can be found in Yang (2015).\\n35.\\tAmanita rubromarginata Har.

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S7), collections of TRTC-150314 (ITS = JX844717) and DMSC09996 (ITS = KT213721), which\\nwere identified as A. hemibapha s. l. by Sa麓nchez-Ram麓谋rez et al. (2015) and Amanita sp. 2 by Parnmen et al. (2016) separately, clustered within A. rubromarginata with strong support. Thus, we consider that these two collections should be assigned to A. rubromarginata.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. rubromarginata is somewhat related to A. javanica. We have checked a specimen of A. javanica from Malaysia. Amanita javanica can be distinguished from A. rubro- marginata by its orange-yellow to ocher yellow pileus with a relatively paler reddish tinge, an orange annulus with a less reddish tinge, and its distribution in tropical forests domi- nated by Dipterocarpaceae (Corner and Bas 1962; Tang et al. 2018; this study).

We have examined the type of A. longistriata and the basidiospores are [100/1/1] (9.5鈥) 10.0鈥13.0 (鈥14.0) 9 (7.5鈥) 8.0鈥11.0 (鈥12.0) lm, Q = (1.03鈥)\\n1.11鈥1.35 (鈥1.56), Qm = 1.22 卤 0.08. In our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), the collection of C. Bas 9040, which was identified as A. longistriata by C. Bas, clusters with the Chinese ones as a monophyletic clade with good support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of collections from this clade match well with the protologue, especially the subglobose basidiospores. Thus, we treat this clade as A. longistriata.\\nAmanita longistriata is phylogenetically related and morphologically similar to A. incarnatifolia, A. ristichii, A. virginiana and A. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b). However, these species can be distinguished from A. longistriata in the following ways. Amanita incarnatifolia has relatively shorter striations on the pileus margin, relatively narrower basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 7.0鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.31鈥1.5,  Qm = 1.4 卤 0.07) and is dominant in  pine, broad-leaved or mixed forests with Pinaceae and Fagaceae (Imazeki and Toki 1955; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana has a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus and white to off-white lamellae (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993).

In  our  phylogenetic  analysis (Fig. 1b), samples of A. hemibapha var. ochracea Zhu L. Yang and A. hemibapha var. hemibapha cluster in distinct clades. Amanita hemibapha var. ochracea differs from A. hemibapha var. hemibapha by its larger and more robust basidioma with a brown umbonate pileus, and its subalpine distribution. Consequently, we treated A. hemibapha var. ochracea as a novel species, A. ochracea.\\nIn our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), three col- lections, RET 317-5 in the multi-locus data, RET 718-7 (ITS = KX810029) and RET 290-5 (ITS = JX 844699) in\\nthe ITS data, which were submitted to NCBI as a provi- sional name of A. cinnamomescens Tulloss et al., clustered together in the monophyletic A ochracea clade. Further- more, the morphological and ecological differences between these three species and A. ochracea are only subtle and they should therefore be considered A. ochra- cea. In addition, one specimen, DAK-M-08 (ITS = KC797155), which was submitted to NCBI under the name\\nA. calyptroderma G. F. Atk. & V. G. Ballen, also clustered within the clade of A.  ochracea  in  our  ITS  analysis  (Fig. S7) and should be A. ochracea.\\nAmanita ochracea is phylogenetically (Figs. 1b, S7) related to A. vernicoccora Bojantchev & R. M. Davis. However, A. vernicoccora, described from the USA, has a relatively smaller basidioma, a yellow pileus covered with a monolithic patch at the center, and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (9.2鈥11.8 9 6.2鈥7.1 lm) (Bojantchev et al.\\n2011).\\nAmanita ochracea is also somewhat similar to A. javanica and A. rubromarginata in its macroscopic appearance. However, the latter two species have a\\n \\nrelatively smaller basidioma, an orange-red to red pileus that is 5鈥13 cm in diameter, yellow lamellae with reddish to orange-red lamellar edges and a reddish to orange-red annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Takahashi 2004; Imazeki et al. 2011; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Amanita ochracea is also comparable to the North Amer- ican A. arkansana H. R. Rosen, but the latter has relatively longer striations on the pileal margin (0.4鈥0.5 R) and smaller basidiospores (7.5鈥10.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Rosen\\n1926; Gilbert 1941a; Jenkins 1986).\\n39.\\tAmanita princeps Corner & Bas, Persoonia 2(3): 297 (1962).\\nPileus 10鈥20 cm in diam., brownish (2B2鈥4), brown (1C4鈥6) to yellow-brown (3C3鈥6), sometimes becoming brownish (2B2鈥4) to yellowish (3A2鈥4) towards margin; volval remnants on pileus absent, or sometimes retained as white (1A1) patches appressed at center; margin shortly striate (0.25鈥0.3 R), non-appendiculate.

KUALA  LUMPUR: Kepong,\\naltitude  unknown,  6  October  1999,  Farid  2830  (FRIM\\n2830).\\nCommentary: Amanita princeps was described from Singapore by Corner and Bas (1962), and subsequently reported from China, India, Malaysia and Thailand (Yang 2005, 2015; Sanmee et al. 2008; Bhatt et al. 2017; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Little information was known of this species from or near its type locality until Tang et al. (2018). Tang et al. (2018) identified A. princeps with both morphological and molecular evidence based on materials from Malaysia (FRIM 62849 and FRIM 2811), which were collected near its type locality and which were morpho- logically consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the Chi- nese specimens clustered with A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849) as two subclades based on PTP analysis. We have examined a specimen of A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849), and the basidiospores were [20/1/1] 8.5鈥10.5 (鈥11.5) 9 7.0鈥10.0 (鈥11.5) lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.18\\n(鈥1.29), Qm = 1.09 卤 0.06. There are subtle morphologi- cal differences between specimens in the two subclades from China and Malaysia, but they share a large basidioma, a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer layer often cracking and peeling into thin patches, and globose, sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores, all of which are consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962). Consequently, we currently con- servatively treated the specimens in these two subclades as\\nA. princeps and submitted their DNA sequences to NCBI under that name. In addition, our phylogenetic data indicate that HKAS 60269, treated as Amanita sp. 8 in Yang (2015), should be A. princeps (Figs. 1b, 2).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. princeps was closely related to the Australian A. egregia D.\\nA. Reid. However, A. egregia has a white basidioma and has an Australian distribution in association with eucalypt trees (Reid 1978, 1980).\\nAmanita princeps can be easily confused with A. pseu- doprinceps Yang-Yang Cui et al. because of the yellow- brown pileus with short striations (0.25鈥0.3 R). However,\\nA. pseudoprinceps, a novel species described in this study, differs from A. princeps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 7鈥12 cm diam., and a white saccate volva with its outer surface not cracking into brownish patches.\\n \\nAmanita princeps is similar to A. aporema, but the latter has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., a more red-brown pileus with longer striations ca.\\n0.5 R, and a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer surface white and not cracking into patches (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. princeps are given in Yang (2005, 2015).\\n40.\\tAmanita pseudoprinceps Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

Thus, these three specimens should be A. pseudoprinceps.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cated that A. pseudoprinceps was sister to A. aporema Boedijn. Based on the original description and the exami- nations of collections, A. aporema differs from A. pseu- doprinceps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., and a relatively darker colored pileus (red-brown) with relatively longer striations (ca. 0.5 R) (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita pseudoprinceps can be confused with A. prin- ceps as they share a yellow-brown pileus with short stria- tions (0.2鈥0.3 R). However, A. princeps differs from A. pseudoprinceps in its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 10鈥20 cm in diam., and a white saccate volva with its outer surface cracking and peeling into thin, brownish patches (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018).\\nAmanita pseudoprinceps is similar to the African A. zambiana Pegler & Piearce in appearance, but the latter has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 10鈥20 cm, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.1 R), saccate volval remnants on the stipe base with its outer surface cracking into large, indefinite verrucae, outer sur- face blackish brown, inner surface red-brown (Pegler and Piearce 1980; Pegler and Shah-Smith 1997).\\nAmanita malayensis Tang et al. and A. similis Boedijn are also similar to A. pseudoprinceps.

The latter was identified based on the collection RET-356-10 (ITS = MF928093)   by   Sa麓nchez-Ram麓谋rez   et   al.   (2015). Whether RET-356-10 represents A. rubroflava or a new taxon needs further morphological studies with more collections.\\nIn China, A. rubroflava can be confused with A. hemi- bapha (Zhang et al. 2004; Yang 2005). Our ITS phyloge- netic analysis (Fig. S7) showed that the collection HKAS 38416 (ITS = AY436460), identified as A. hemibapha in Zhang et al. (2004) and Yang (2005), clustered within the\\nA. rubroflava clade with strong support. Consequently, HKAS 38416 should be determined as A. rubroflava. In addition, A. hemibapha differs morphologically from A. rubroflava by its non-umbonate pileus, narrower basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥6.5) and its tropical distribution (Gilbert 1941a; Pegler 1986; Vrinda et al. 2005; Sanmee  et al. 2008; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubroflava is similar to A. caesareoides in that they share umbonate pilei and the basidiospores are of similar size, however, the latter has a more red to orange- red pileus and is dominant in temperate East Asia (Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988; Cho et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Endo et al. 2016).\\nAmanita caesarea and A. masasiensis Ha篓rk. & Saarim. are also comparable to A. rubroflava in their macroscopic appearance. However, the European A. caesarea has a robuster basidioma with an obviously shorter stipe, an orange pileus lacking an umbo and longer basidiospores (8.5鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu\\n2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita masasiensis, described from Tanzania, has a relatively smaller basid- ioma, a non-umbonate pileus, ellipsoid to elongate basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 6.0鈥7.0 lm), and is dominant in woodland often with trees of the genera Brachystegia, Combretum, Julbernardia, Syzygium and Uapaca (Ha篓rko篓- nen et al. 1994; Tang et al. 2015).\\n42.\\tAmanita similis Boedijn, Sydowia 5(3-6): 322 (1951).\\n \\nPileus dark brown (4E4鈥6), brown (4D4鈥6) to oliva- ceous brown (3C3鈥6); volval remnants on pileus absent; margin striate.

Yang (2005) cited four specimens under the name A. similis, which were morphologically similar to\\nA. similis, but no DNA sequences were generated from the collections. In this study, we continue to treat these four Chinese specimens as A. similis.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 1b) indicate that\\nA. similis is related to A. subhemibapha and A. fuscoflava. However, A. subhemibapha has a yellow to yellowish pileus with its center orange and relatively shorter stria- tions (0.25鈥0.35 R) on the pileal margin.

However, these species differ from A. similis in the following ways. A. malayensis has a yellow pileus with its center yellowish orange, maize yellow or saffron yel- low, relatively shorter striations (0.3鈥0.4 R) on the pileal margin, a yellow stipe decorated with yellow scales, and a yellowish white to whitish annulus (Tang et al. 2018).

However, A. chatamagotake has a yellow or grayish yellow stipe without orange scales, a yellow annulus and relatively shorter striations (0.2鈥0.5 R) on the pileal margin (Endo et al. 2017).

For the comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. fus- coflava. In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S7), col- lection TRTC-150286 (ITS = JX844714) from Thailand, which  was  identified  as  A.  hemibapha  s.  l.  by  Sa麓nchez- Ram麓谋rez et al. (2015), clustered with A. subhemibapha and should be a renamed as such.\\nSpecies morphologically comparable to A. sub- hemibapha include A. hemibapha, A. javanica and A. rubromarginata. However, A. hemibapha possesses a red- der pileus and narrower basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9  5.5鈥6.5) (Gilbert 1941a; Pegler 1986; Vrinda et al. 2005; Sanmee et al. 2008; Yang 2015; this study). Amanita javanica and A. rubromarginata have a redder pileus with relatively longer striations on the pileal margin (ca. 0.5 R), yellow lamellae with reddish to orange-red lamellar edges and a reddish to orange-red annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Takahashi 2004; Imazeki et al. 2011; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita rubroflava Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang, A. caesarea and A. caesareoides are also similar to\\nA.\\tsubhemibapha in appearance. However, A. rubroflava, a novel species described in this study, differs from A. sub- hemibapha in its distinctly umbonate pileus and slightly broader basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm). The European A. caesarea has a robuster basidioma with a shorter stipe, a redder pileus with shorter striations on its margin and larger basidiospores (8.5鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita caesareoides has a redder umbonate pileus, and is dominant in temperate East Asia (Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988; Cho et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Endo et al. 2016).\\n45.\\tAmanita yuaniana Zhu L.

Commentary: Amanita yuaniana was described from China by Yang (1994). Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. yuaniana is related to A. hunanensis. However, A. hunanensis differs from A. yuaniana in the relatively longer striations on its margin (ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R) and fairly abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base (Peng and Liu 1981; Yang and Zhang 2002;\\nYang 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita esculenta and A. spreta are also morphologi- cally similar to A. yuaniana. However, A. esculenta can be distinguished from A. yuaniana by its pileus lacking innate speckles (Matsuda and Hongo 1955; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita spreta, described form the USA, has a pileus lacking innate speckles and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.2鈥13.3 9 5.5鈥7 lm) (Murrill 1913; Coker 1917;\\nJenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line draw- ings   and   images   of    A.    yuaniana    see    Yang (1994, 1997, 2005, 2015).\\n \\n\\nAmanita  sect.  Vaginatae  (Fr.)

Vaginatae is often difficult (Bas 1977). In this study, we documented 32 Chinese taxa from this section based on multi-locus phylogenetic, mor- phological and partial ecological evidence, including 13 novel species and 19 known taxa (17 species and two varieties). Amanita atrofusca Zhu L. Yang was treated as a novel synonym of A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille. The microscopic structure of the volva, including the arrange- ment and proportion of inflated cells and filamentous hyphae, seems to be one of the most important traits for the characterization of the species in this section. In addition, DNA sequences are very useful for delimitation of the species.\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

It is worth mentioning that specimens have also been collected with whitish, dirty white to brownish pilei, which may be caused by mutations or differently environmental conditions.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cates that A. albidostipes is related to A. brunneoprocera and A. orienticrocea. However, A. brunneoprocera can be easily distinguished from A. albidostipes by its dark gray, gray-brown to gray pileus and a white to dirty white stipe covered with gray to dark gray fibrils. For comparisons between A. albidostipes and A. orienticrocea see the commentary on A. orienticrocea.\\nThe European A. crocea is similar to A. albidostipes in the color of basidiomata and the size of basidiospores, but the former differs by its brighter colored basidioma with an orange tinge, and its stipe surface densely covered with orange  to  orange-ocheraceous  squamules  (Gilbert   1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000;  Tulloss  1997, 2000a; Galli 2001).\\nThe yellow-brown pileus and globose to subglobose basidiospores of A. orientifulva are also comparable to those of A. albidostipes, but A.  orientifulva  has  a  larger basidioma, larger basidiospores (10.0鈥14.0 9 9.5鈥13.0 lm), more inflated cells in the inner part of the volva on the stipe base, and is found in subalpine forests (Yang 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita hamadae, a species described from Japan, is similar to A. albidostipes in morphological appearance. However, A. hamadae has broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 7.5鈥9.0 lm) and is dominant\\n \\nin subalpine forests with trees of the genera Picea and\\nAbies (Nagasawa and Hongo 1984; Yang 2015).\\n47.\\tAmanita  angustilamellata  (Ho篓 hn.)

(TYPE, FH 4712).\\nCommentary: Amanita angustilamellata was described from Java by Boedijn (1951), and subsequently reported from China, Malaysia and Singapore (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017). This species is characterized by its gray-brown pileus without an umbo, longer striations up to 0.5 R on the pileal margin, sparse lamellae, a small, white saccate volva on stipe base, globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.5鈥11.0 9 9.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.05,  Qm = 1.03 卤 0.13), and the absence of clamps.\\nThe diagnosis mentioned in the protologue of this taxon (as Amanitopsis vaginata var. angustilamellata) was very brief, and since then few reliable descriptions have been made (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Pegler 1986;\\nYang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017). Consequently, the delimita- tion of A. angustilamellata remains poorly understand.\\nCorner and Bas (1962) mentioned that the narrow gills of this species may be an unreliable character. Pegler (1986) reported the presence of clamps in the pileipellis based on Sri Lankan materials, but this differed from the reports of Corner and Bas (1962) and Yang (2005). Boedijn (1951) and Lee (2017) did not mention the presence or absence of clamps of this species. Based on the protologue and reexamination of the type (FH 4712), HKAS 24158 was identified as A. angustilamellata by Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). In this study, we follow the treatments of\\nA. angustilamellata in Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of the Chinese A. angustilamel- lata see Yang (2005).\\nYang (2015) reported the presence of A. angustilamel- lata in China based on HKAS 83453. However, our multi- locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicated that HKAS 83453 grouped together with HKAS 89451 as a distinct clade, and collections in this clade had a more northern subtropical to temperate distribution compared with A. angustilamellata. Thus, HKAS 83453 and HKAS 89451 may represent a novel species, but its classification cannot be clarified until further collections are made to better estimate morphological characters and geographic distributions.\\n48.\\tAmanita battarrae (Boud.)

Since few morphological differences were observed between these two phylogenetic species, we treat them as a single species in this study, a conclusion which was also supported by our PTP analysis (Fig. 2). No species closely related to A. battarrae were detected from our current data (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) suggested that HKAS 56255, treated as A. vaginata (Bull.) Lam. var. vaginata by Yang (2015), should be A. battarrae. Amanita battarrae is morphologically similar to A. brunneofuliginea Zhu L. Yang, A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille and A. griseoumbonata Yang-Yang Cui et al. However, A. brunneofuliginea has a relatively larger basidioma with a pileus ca. 5鈥14 cm in diam. and rela- tively broader basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm,\\nQ = 1.06鈥1.24,  Qm = 1.13 卤 0.06)  (Yang  1997,  2005,\\n2015).

In our multi-locus phyloge- netic data (Fig. 2), specimens of A. aff. brunneofuliginea from Europe and A. brunneofuliginea specimens from Asia split into two sister clades.

However, A. constricta has a relatively larger and robuster basidioma with a gray to brownish gray pileus ca. 5鈥13 cm in diam., lamellae at first white and then becoming gray, and gray lamellar edges. Moreover, A. constricta occurs during the winter months in the USA (Thiers and Ammirati 1982; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss 1994). Amanita cinnamomea has cinnamon lamellar edges and distributed in tropical forests with trees of Fagaceae (Thongbai et al. 2018).\\nAmanita tenuifulva, a novel species described in this study, is easily confused with A. changtuia. However, A. tenuifulva has a non-umbonate pileus and is found in the southern regions of China. The European A. fulva is similar to A. changtuia in the color of its pileus and the similar\\n \\nbasidiospores. However, A. fulva has a relatively shorter stipe, and a brownish, saccate volva with inflated cells dominant in the outer part (Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000; Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita orientifulva also somewhat resembles A. changtuia in appearance. However, A. orientifulva has a robuster and larger basidioma, a brownish volva with abundant inflated cells in its inner part, and relatively larger basidiospores (10鈥14 9 9.5鈥13 lm) (Yang et al. 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015).\\n52.\\tAmanita chiui Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

However, the European A. ceciliae dif- fers from A. griseofolia by its brown pileus with a yellow tinge, white lamellae that do not change to gray when dried and more filamentous hyphae in the volval remnants on the pileus  (Phillips  1990;  Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995; Massart 2000; Yang 2004, 2005, 2015; this study).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cates that A. griseofolia is also somewhat related to A. submembranacea (Bon) Gro篓ger, but the latter has a brown, brownish to buff pileus with an olivaceous tinge, volval remnants on the pileus are absent or retained as patches mostly concentrated over the disc, a saccate volva on the stipe base and distributions in forest dominated by Abies and Picea (Tulloss 1994; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; this study).\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. griseofolia see Yang (2004, 2005, 2015).\\n56.\\tAmanita griseoumbonata Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

Furthermore, it is associated with trees of the family Fagaceae.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cates that A. neocinctipes is related to A. lippiae Wartchow & Tulloss. However, A. lippiae has a pale beige pileus covered with numerous scattered white patches, no annulus or an apparent small subbasal pendant annulus, mostly collar-like volval remnants on the stipe base, ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (10.0鈥21.0 9 7.0鈥11.0 lm), and is\\n \\nfound in sandy soil under Lippia trees (Wartchow et al. 2009).\\nTo date, four species of A. sect.

The former three species can be separated from A. neocinctipes by molecular phylogenetic, morphological and ecological evidence. Amanita cinctipes differs from A. neocinctipes in its globose to subglobose basidiospores (8.7鈥11.5 9 7.9鈥10.1 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; this study). Amanita griseofolia can be distinguished from A. neocinctipes by its globose to subglobose basidiospores (10.0鈥13.5 9 9.5鈥13.0 lm), and its distribution in mixed forests (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015). Amanita liquii is different from A. neocinctipes by its relatively larger and darker basidioma, larger basidiospores (11.5鈥15.0 9 11.0鈥14.5 lm) and its\\nsubalpine distribution (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n61.\\tAmanita nivalis Grev., Scott. crypt. fl.

Watling (1985) proposed the collection R. Watling 17489 (E) as a neotype of A. nivalis. Tulloss et al. (2015) proposed Watling鈥檚 neotype [R. Watling 17489 (E)] as an epitype, and suggested three iso-epitypes deposited in L (0053705), NY (01937400), and RET (042-5, fragments). The nrLSU sequence of the iso-epitype deposited in L was provided by Wei脽 et al. (1998).\\nWe have examined the iso-epitype deposited in L, and the basidiospores were [20/1/1] (9.5鈥) 10.0鈥11.5 9 (8.5鈥)\\n9.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = (1.0鈥) 1.02鈥1.14 (鈥1.16), Qm = 1.09\\n卤 0.04, globose to subglobose. Yang (2005, 2015) reported A. nivalis from China. Unfortunately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from the Chinese specimens due to their poor condition. New material from subalpine areas near snow-line in southwestern China, from which we are able to generate DNA sequences, will shed new light on the phylogeny and taxonomy of this taxon.\\n62.\\tAmanita olivaceofusca Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

Vaginatae, but our study did not suggest any species closely related to it (Fig. 1b). Mor- phologically, A. angustilamellata can be easily confused with A. olivaceofusca because of its slender basidioma and tropical to subtropical distribution, but A. angustilamellata has a relatively larger basidioma, a darker colored pileus and globose to subglobose basidiospores\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFig. 24 Microscopic features of Amanita orienticrocea (TYPE, HKAS 90455). a Hymenium and subhymenium; b basidiospores.

However, A. tenuifulva can be easily distinguished from A. olivaceofusca by its globose to subglobose basidiospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 10.0鈥11.5 lm) and abundant inflated cells in the outer part of the volva.\\nAmanita albidostipes and A. fulva are similar to A. oli- vaceofusca in appearance. However, the former two spe- cies possess a larger basidioma, shorter striations on the pileal margin, and globose to subglobose basidiospores [9.0鈥11.0  9 8.0鈥10.0  lm   for    A.    albidostipes;  (9.0鈥)\\n10.0鈥12.0 (鈥17.5) 9 (8.0鈥) 9.0鈥11.0 (鈥14.0) lm for A.\\nfulva] (Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000; Galli 2001;  Yang  et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). In addition, A. albidostipes, a novel species described in this study, has scarce inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base, and is found in association with Pinus. The European species, A. fulva, has a saccate volva with abundant inflated cells in its outer part, and it is found in temperate forests (Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000; Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n63.\\tAmanita orienticrocea Zhu L.

Singer.\\n \\nIndeed, they are similar morphologically in that they share a yellow pileus. However, the European A. crocea differs from A. orienticrocea by its obviously saffron orange pileus, white lamellae lacking a gray tinge and a stipe decorated with distinctly orange  squamules  (Gilbert  1940, 1941a; Tulloss 1997, 2000a; Contu 2000a; Massart 2000; Galli 2001).\\nIn China, A. orienticrocea is morphologically similar to\\nA. orientifulva Zhu L. Yang, M. Wei脽 & Oberw. and A. albidostipes Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang. However, A. orientifulva has a dark brown to red-brown pileus, brown to brownish lamellar edges, a dirty white stipe covered with red-brown to gray-brown squamules, brown patches on the outer surface of the volva, relatively larger basidiospores (10鈥14 9 9.5鈥13 lm), and is found in subalpine forests (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita albidostipes has a non-umbonate pileus, white lamellae without gray tinge when young, and the outer surface of the volva often has a brown tinge.\\nIn addition, A. subnudipes (Romagn.) Tulloss and A. romagnesiana Tulloss are also similar to A. orienticrocea. However, A. subnudipes has an orange pileus and relatively narrower   basidiospores    (8.9鈥12.2 9 7.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.12鈥1.16) (Tulloss 2000a, b). Amanita romagnesiana has a non-umbonate, bright orange-tawny pileus, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (B 0.2 R), pale cream lamellae, and a pale brownish orange stipe decorated with pale orange floccules (Tulloss 1994, 2000a, b).\\n64.\\tAmanita orientifulva Zhu L.

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S8), A. subovalispora, a species described from Thailand (Thongbai et al. 2018), also clustered within the A. oval- ispora complex. Further studies are needed to classify the\\nA. ovalispora complex accurately.

However, A. pallidocarnea can be easily distinguished from A. palli- dozonata by its red to pinkish lamellae, a pinkish stipe covered with minute, concolorous squamules and associa- tions with broad-leaved  trees  (Boedijn  1951;  Yang  2001, 2005, 2015).\\nThe pale, ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations and globose to subglobose basid- iospores of A. pallidozonata are reminiscent of A. umbri- nolutea, but the latter has a darker colored basidioma, and scarce inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base\\n \\n\\n \\n(Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita zonata, a novel species described in this study, also has a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the mar- ginal striations and could be confused with A. pallido- zonata. However, A. zonata has relatively smaller basidiospores (9.0鈥10.5 9 8.5鈥10.0 lm) and it is found in tropical forests with Fagaceae.\\nThe Chinese A. brunneofuliginea resembles A. pallido- zonata in that they share a brown-colored pileus. However,\\nA. brunneofuliginea has a relatively larger basidioma, a brown pileus lacking a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and abundant inflated cells in the outer  part  of  the  volva  on  the  stipe  base   (Yang   1997, 2005, 2015).\\n68.\\tAmanita pseudovaginata Hongo, Mem.

Because there are abundant inflated cells in the outer part of the volva, the volva can easily be broken during the development of the basidioma. Specimens of A. retenta with entirely white basidiomata have also been collected in the field.\\nOur phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not uncover any species closely related to A. retenta. Amanita retenta is morphologically similar to A. nivalis, described from Europe. However, A. nivalis has a relatively shorter basidioma with its stipe ca. 4鈥8 cm long, and was descri- bed as a snow-bed agaric in association with Carex, Gal- ium and Polytrichum (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Watling 1985; Campo and Bizio 2000; Contu 2000b; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are also similar to A. retenta in macroscopic appearance. However, they can be separated from A. retenta in their broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm for A. ovalispora; 10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm for\\nA. pseudovaginata), and the inflated cells are concentrated\\n \\nin the inner part of the volva (Boedijn 1951; Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nThe white basidioma of A. retenta could be misidenti- fied as the European A. vaginata var. alba Gillet. For example, HKAS 82591 was erroneously treated as A. vaginata var. alba by Yang (2015) and should be a species of A. retenta based on our ITS  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. S8). However, A. vaginata var. alba differs from the white basidioma of A. retenta by the absence of volval remnants on the pileus, and the irregularly distributed, brownish spots on the outer surface of the volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Galli 2001).\\n70.\\tAmanita shennongjiana Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

Indeed, A. griseoumbonata is morphologically similar to A. shennongjiana and they share a slender basidioma with an umbonate pileus, globose to subglobose basidiospores and a similar structure of the volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. griseoumbonata differs from A. shennongjiana by its darker-colored pileus and is found in coniferous or mixed forests.\\nThe European A. vaginata var. vaginata is similar to A. shennongjiana in appearance, but A. vaginata var. vaginata has a robust basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus with rela- tively shorter striations on the margin and a relatively thicker volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are some- what similar to A. shennongjiana. However, A. ovalispora has a robuster basidioma, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm), a more robust volva on the stipe base, and occurs in more southern regions (Boedijn 1951; this study). Amanita pseudovagi- nata possesses a relatively paler-colored pileus and sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) (Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang\\nand Doi 1999).\\n \\n71.\\tAmanita tenuifulva Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu\\nL.

Although there are some subtle morphological differences between the Chinese populations and the European ones (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015), these may be caused by different environmental conditions. Therefore, A. atrofusca is trea- ted here as a synonym of A. umbrinolutea.\\nAmanita umbrinolutea is phylogenetically related to A. pachycolea D. E. Stuntz and Amanita sp. (Figs. 1b, S8). However, Amanita pachycolea differs from A. umbrino- lutea in that its white lamellae are unchanging or becoming tawny to orange-brown or orange-yellow with age, and the presence of clamps (Thiers and Ammirati 1982; Thiers 1982; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss 1994).

(L).\\nCommentary: The concept of A. vaginata var. vaginata remains rudimentary because no nomenclatural type has been assigned in order to delimit it precisely. Wei脽 et al. (1998) provided an nrLSU sequence of A. vaginata var. vaginata based on a specimen, H. A. v. d. Aa s.n. (L), and we follow Wei脽鈥檚 treatment here (Fig. 2). We have examined the collection H. A. v. d.

It is generally recognized that A. vaginata var. vaginata is characterized by a gray pileus with striations at the margin, a white stipe lacking an annulus and globose to subglobose basidiospores [9.0鈥13.0 (鈥14.0)  lm]  (Lange   1935;  Huijsman  1959;  Bas   1967;\\nHorak 1968; Jenkins 1986; Breitenbach and Kra篓nzlin 1995; Tulloss et al. 1995). Based on these characters, we treated the Chinese collections listed in Yang (2005) as A. vagi- nata var. vaginata for the time being. Unfortunately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from these Chi- nese collections.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not suggest any species closely related to A. vaginata var. vaginata. In addition, HKAS 56255, treated as A. vaginata var. vaginata by Yang (2015), should be A.  battarrae  (Fig. 1b).

Amanita zonata can be confused with A. umbrinolutea because of the gray-brown pileus with an indistinct dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and similar basidiospores. However, A. umbrinolutea, a species described from Europe and also found in China, has a darker basidioma, brownish to gray-brown lamellar edges, obvious brown spots on the outer surface of the volva, and relatively larger basid- iospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a;\\nContu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001;\\nNeville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. umbrinolutea is dominant in temperate regions (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora, a species described from Indonesia, is similar to A. zonata in appearance and habitats, but the former can be distinguished from the latter by the grayer to darker gray pileus lacking an obvious dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm) (Boedijn\\n1951; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nIn China, A. brunneofuliginea is somewhat similar to A. zonata in the gray-brown pileus. However, A. brunneo- fuliginea can be easily distinguished from A. zonata by its darker pileus lacking a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, brown squamules on the outer surface of the volva, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm), and habitat in\\nplantations in subalpine forests (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita subgen.

(2016) proposed Aspidella and Saproamanita respectively to accommodate Amanita vittadinii and its allies (A. sub-  sect. Vittadiniae Bas), and resurrected the subgeneric name Amanitina, typified by A. phalloides, for the remaining species of A. subgen. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969), with the exception of A. subsect. Vittadinii. Our multi-locus phylogenetic anal- ysis indicates that A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic (Fig. 1a, b). To keep the infrageneric taxonomic stability of Amanita (Tulloss et al. 2016), we follow the con- cept of A. subgen. Amanitina as circumscribed by Redhead et al. (2016), but retain the species complex of Amanita vit- tadinii as its own section, A. sect. Lepidella Corner & Bas.\\n\\nKey to the sections of Amanita subgen.\\nAmanitina\\n1.

We describe here four novel species, which, together with the three previ- ously known species give a total of seven species of A. sect. Amidella recognized in China.

Neither did Gilbert (1940) formally designate a type, but he illustrated five basidiospores of this species based on the collection made by S. Imai in the Nopporo forests on October 11, 1931. We examined two fragments of this collection but, unfortunately, no basid- iospores were observed. In our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. clarisquamosa is found to be related to A. volvata. However, collections of A. volvata listed under A. brunneomaculata have basidioma with an obvious reddish brown color change when bruised or injured, and is documented as being found in mixed forests in North American (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).

It is putatively associated with pine trees (e.g. Pinus yunnanensis).\\nAmanita pinophila formed a distinct lineage in our phylogenetic study (Fig. 1b). Amanita pinophila can be easily confused morphologically with A. volvata. However, specimens of A. volvata, which are listed in specimens studied under A. brunneomaculata, have basidiomata with a distinct reddish brown color change when bruised or injured  and   slightly   narrower   basidiospores  (10.0鈥12.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.5鈥1.85, Qm = 1.67 卤\\n0.11) (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).\\nThe East Asian A. avellaneosquamosa and A. clar- isquamosa are also similar to A. pinophila in their white to brownish basidiomata. However, A. avellaneosquamosa has longer striations on the pileal margin, and relatively shorter  basidiospores  (9.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm)  (Imai\\n1933; Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang\\nand Doi 1999). Amanita clarisquamosa has a relatively larger  basidioma   and   longer   basidiospores   (Imai 1933, 1938; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al.\\n2011).\\nAmanita brunneomaculata and A. rufobrunnescens share some characters with A. pinophila. However, they have larger basidiomata. Furthermore, A. brunneomaculata has broader basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 6.5鈥8.0, Qm = 1.65\\n卤 0.19). Amanita rufobrunnescens has a white to brown- ish basidioma with a distinct reddish brown color change when bruised, and occurs in subtropical forests with broad- leaved trees (Deng et al. 2016).\\n84.\\tAmanita rufobrunnescens W.

This species is charac- terized by its white basidioma with a reddish brown color change when bruised or injured, a shortly striate pileal margin,   elongate   basidiospores   (10鈥12 9 5.5鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.5鈥2, Qm = 1.78 卤 0.17), and an association with subtropical broad-leaved trees (Deng et al. 2016).\\nOur phylogenetic study did not reveal any species clo- sely related to A. rufobrunnescens (Fig. 1b). The North American A. volvata is morphologically similar to A. rufobrunnescens in the white basidiomata changing to reddish brown when bruised. However, specimens of A. volvata from the USA, which are listed in specimens examined under A. brunneomaculata, have a thicker sub- hymenium with 3鈥4 layers of inflated cells and relatively broader basidiospores (10鈥12.5 9 6鈥7.5 lm,\\nQ = 1.5鈥1.85,   Qm = 1.67 卤 0.11)   (Bas   1969; Jenkins\\n1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).\\nIn China, A. brunneomaculata, A. clarisquamosa, A. lanigera and A. albidostipes may be confused with A. rufobrunnescens. However, these four species have basid- iomata lacking the distinct reddish brown color change when bruised or injured (Imai 1933, 1938; Yang\\n \\n\\n \\n1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011; this study).

On sandy soil, only known in south-western and western Australia and puta- tively associated with ectomycorhizal partners of Euca- lyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton.\\nCommentary: Previous data and our multi-locus phylo- genetic study indicate that eight sequestrate species are currently  known  in  Amanita  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and\\n \\nHorak 1992; Bougher 1999; Bougher and Lebel 2002; Hallen et al. 2004; Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017). Of these, A. arenaria was described as belonging to Torrendia and was then transferred to Amanita by Justo et al. (2010). It clustered with two agaricoid species, A. lesueurii E.\\nM. Davison and A. wadjukiorum E. M. Davison, originally described from Western Australia and assigned to the stirps Strobiliformis of A. sect.  Lepidella  sensu  Bas  (Davison et al. 2013), as a distinct clade with strong statistic support. Furthermore, species in this clade are characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidiomata, smooth basid- iospores; the absence of clamps and their distributions in south-western and western Australia in association with Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton. We therefore treated this clade as a novel section.\\nOur multigene-phylogenetic data (Fig. 1a) strongly indicate that A. sect. Arenariae shares a common ancestor with A. sect. Phalloideae, sect. Validae and sect. Strobili- formes. Fungi from these sections usually have amyloid basidiospores. However, this is not the case for the species\\nA.\\tarenaria. Justo et al. (2010) suggested that A. arenaria probably evolved from an amyloid-spored ancestor but this character was lost during the gasteromycetation process. To date, no species of A. sect. Arenariae has been reported from China.\\nAmanita  sect.  Phalloideae  (Fr.)  Que麓l.,  Me麓m.  Soc.  Emul. Montbe麓liard, Ser.

Phal- loideae could be separated into three subclades with high support (lethal Amanita subclade, A. hesleri-A. zangii subclade, and A. pseudogemmata-A. ballerina subclade), which may be treated as separate subsections. However, we will not formally propose such taxonomic changes until more  taxa  are  studied.  To  date,  15  species   of   A.  sect.

The fatalities caused by lethal Amanita species are presented in Fig. 35. Species in this subclade are characterized by a non-striate pileus rarely covered membranous volval remnants, attenuate lamellulae, a basal bulb with a limbate volva and the absence of clamps. To date, 12 lethal Amanita species have been found in China (see below).\\nOnly two species, A. hesleri and A. zangii, were rec- ognized from the Amanita hesleri Bas subclade, and both were previously assigned to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969). Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both should be in A. sect. Phalloideae (Cai et al. 2014; Figs. 1b, S11), although neither amatoxins nor phallotoxins were detected in the basidiomata of A. zangii (Cai et al. 2014). Species in this subclade are characterized by their subconical to flat verrucose, felty to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal margins, slenderly clavate to subfusiform base covered with floccose or warted volval remnants and the absence of clamps. To date, only A. zangii has been found in China (see below). Currently, four species are known from the A. pseudo- gemmata subclade: A. pseudogemmata Hongo, A. levistri- ata D. T. Jenkins, A. ballerina Raspe麓 et al. and A. franzii Zhu L. Yang et al. (Figs. 1b, S11). Species in this subclade are characterized by their striate pileal margins, truncate to nearly truncate lamellulae, marginate to sublimbate bulbs, (weakly) amyloid basidiospores and the absence of clamps. Amatoxins or phallotoxins have not been detected in A. pseudogemmata, A. ballerina and A. franzii (Cai et al.\\n \\n2014; Thongbai et al. 2017). To date, A. pseudogemmata\\nand A. franzii have been found in China (see below).\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

This species belongs to the lethal Amanita subclade in A. sect. Phalloideae. Cyclope- tide toxins, in particular a-amanitin and b-amanitin, are\\n \\ndetected in all parts of the basidioma and at different stages of development (Deng et al. 2011; Xue  et al. 2011; Hu     et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014b; Chen et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016). It is the leading cause of mushroom poisonings in Guangdong Province, China, where from 2000 to 2014, 22 cases of mushroom poisoning were reported, resulting in 89 affected individuals and 45 deaths (Yang and Li 2001; Deng et al. 2011; Xue et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2012; Cai et al. 2014; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2014, 2016; Li et al. 2014b; Tang et al. 2016).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) shows that A. exitialis is sister to the North American A. subal- liacea (Murrill) Murrill (Cai et al. 2014). Examination of specimens of A. suballiacea from North America indi- cates  that  it  has  4-spored  basidia   and   smaller,  broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.2鈥1.4, Qm = 1.29 卤 0.08) (Murrill\\n1941; Jenkins 1979, 1986; this study). Furthermore, the outer layer of volval remnants on the stipe base in A. suballiacea is composed of wide filamentous hyphae up to 20 lm in diam., while those in A. exitialis are 2鈥7 lm in diam. For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. exitialis see Yang and Li (2001), Yang (2005, 2015) and Cai et al. (2016).\\n86.\\tAmanita franzii Zhu L.

Phalloideae and is closely related to A. ballerina. However, A. ballerina can be distinguished from A. franzii by its relatively smaller basidioma and a white pileus covered with white to cream patchy volval remnants (Thongbai et al. 2017).\\nAmanita pseudogemmata is comparable to A. franzii in the marginate basal bulb. However, A. pseudogemmata differs from A. franzii by its yellow pileus covered with yellow to yellow-brown volval remnants, and a yellow stipe with its basal bulb covered with collar-like, white to yellowish volval remnants (Hongo 1974b; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nThe marginate bulb of Amanita franzii and the nature of the volval remnants are reminiscent of species of A. sub- sect. Limbatulae, including A. mutabilis Beardslee, A. parva (Murrill) Murrill, and A. praelongispora (Murrill) Murrill, which were described from the USA. However, these American taxa have sublimbate stipe bases and pro- portionally narrower basidiospores (Beardslee 1919; Mur- rill 1941, 1945; Bas 1969; Jenkins 1979, 1986; Tulloss\\n \\n\\n \\n1984). In addition, the latter two species have clamps (Beardslee 1919; Murrill 1941, 1945; Bas 1969; Jenkins\\n1979, 1986; Tulloss 1984).\\n87.\\tAmanita fuliginea Hongo, Journ. Jap.

(2010), and subsequently reported from Thailand (Thongbai et al. 2017). This species is a member of the lethal Amanita subclade in A. sect. Phal- loideae. Cyclopetide toxins, including a-amanitin, b- amanitin and phalloidin, have been detected in the basid- ioma of A. fuligineoides, thus, acute liver failure would be caused by ingestion of this species (Chen et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016; Thongbai et al. 2017).\\nOur phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. fuligineoides is closely related to A. brunneitoxicaria Thongbai et al., which is in agreement with the conclusions of Thongbai et al. (2017). However, A. brunneitoxicaria differs from A. fuligineoides by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 3.5鈥4.5 in diam., a paler colored\\n \\nstipe (white to pale grayish brown) and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.9鈥9.8 9 6.8鈥7.7 lm, Q = 1.2鈥\\n1.42, Qm = 1.27 卤 0.3) (Thongbai et al. 2017).

This spe- cies has caused at least five deaths (Zhang et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2011; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2016), and high levels of cyclopetide toxins have been detected in the basidioma of A. pallidorosea (Li et al. 2014a; Tang et al. 2016).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled as A. pallidorosea split into two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Because the differences between indi- viduals in these two subclades were only subtle, we treat them here as a single species, A. pallidorosea. Phyloge- netically, A. pallidorosea was closely related to A. bis- porigera G. F. Atk (Fig. 1b). However, specimens of A. bisporigera from the USA have a non-umbonate pileus, 2-spored basidia and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥9.5 9 7.5鈥9.0 lm) (Lewis 1906; Gilbert 1940, 1941a;\\nJenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).

Hongo 420] (Holotype, TNS-F-237280).\\nCommentary: Amanita pseudogemmata was described from Japan and treated as a species of A. sect. Amanita due to its striate pileal margin, pulverulent volval remnants on the pileus, a marginate to sublimbate stipe base, and the absence of clamps (Hongo 1974b; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it should be in A. sect. Phalloideae having amyloid basidiospores. Careful reexamination of the col- lections cited above showed that the basidiospores are indeed amyloid, but only weakly.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S11), A. pseudogemmata is sister to A. levistriata. However, the latter differs morphologically in its relatively smaller basidioma with a ca. 1.7鈥3 cm in diam. pileus, volval remnants on the pileus as floccose patches at center, becoming flocculose towards the margin, and its occur- rence in sandy soils in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (Jenkins 1988).

This  species  is  deadly  poisonous (Kawase et al. 1992; Imazeki et al. 1988; Chen et al. 2016; Tang     et al. 2016). The albino form of A. subjunquillea was treated  as  A.  subjunquillea   var.   alba   by   Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015). Since few genetic differences between the albino form and the non-albino form are present, we treat A. subjunquillea var. alba as a synonym of A. sub- junquillea var. subjunquillea (Cai et al. 2014).\\n \\nPhylogenetically, A. subjunquillea is closely related to\\nA. phalloides (Vaill.:Fr.) Link (Fig. 1b). Indeed, they are also morphologically similar to each other. However, A. phalloides differs from A. subjunquillea in its robust basidioma and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.29, Qm = 1.19 卤 0.06) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

This lethal Amanita species is known to have caused two deaths in Guizhou Province, China in 2014  (Li  et al. 2015;  Chen  et al. 2016). Thirteen cyclopeptides were subsequently identified from the species (Wei et al. 2017).\\nAccording to our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis  (Fig. 1b), collection HKAS 27133, which was identified as\\nA. cf. virosa by Wei脽 et al.

However, A. virosa has a stipe covered with recurved squamules, and larger basidiospores (Contu 2000a; Chiusa 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Zhang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Cai et al. 2016; this study). Furthermore, A. virosa is dominant in temperate Eurasia (Contu 2000a; Chiusa 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Zhang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Cai et al. 2016; this study).

This species has a wide distribution across Europe and temperate to sub- tropical Asia (Contu 2000a; Chiusa 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004, Zhang et al. 2010, Li et al. 2015, Yang 2015; Cai et al. 2016; this study). Cyclopetide toxins have been detected in basidiomata collected from Europe (Wieland et al. 1978; Faulstich et al. 1980; Buku et al. 1980a, b; Wienland and Faulstich 1991; Antonyuk et al. 2010; Wieland 2012) and from East Asia (Li et al. 2014a; Tang et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2017).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cated that A. virosa is closely related to A. subpallidorosea, and the comparisons between them were presented in the commentary on A. subpallidorosea. For detailed descrip- tions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. virosa see Yang (2015).\\n99.\\tAmanita zangii Zhu L. Yang, T. H. Li & X. L.

Clamps absent in all parts of basidioma.\\nHabitat: Solitary to scattered on soil in tropical to subtropical forests; basidioma occurring from summer to autumn.\\nDistribution: Known in southern China (Yang et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; this study), Japan (Oda et al. 2002a, identified as A. areolata) and Thailand (Thongbai  et al. 2016, 2017).\\nSpecimens examined: CHINA. HAINAN PROVINCE: Qiongzhong County, Limushan, in a tropical to subtropical forest, altitude 750 m, 4 August 2010, Nian-Kai Zeng 835 (HKAS 77331); same location, in a forest dominated by Fagaceae, altitude 840 m, 21 June 2016, Gang Wu 1546 (HKAS 99663); Ledong County, Jianfengling, in a tropical to subtropical forest, altitude 900 m, 20 August 1999,\\nMing-Sheng Yuan 4346 (HOLOTYPE, HKAS 34570).\\nCommentary:  Amanita  zangii  was  placed   in   A.  sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) exclusively based on morphological study, due to the felted to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal mar- gins, narrowly clavate to subfusiform stipe bases, and the volval remnants on the pileus with long ellipsoid to sub- fusiform  inflated  cells  (Yang  et  al.   2001;   Yang   2005, 2015). It was suggested that this species is very similar to A. hesleri and A. inopinata D. A. Reid & Bas (Yang et al. 2001). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it is indeed sister to A. hesleri Bas, but that it should  be moved to A. sect. Phalloideae  (Cai  et al. 2014; this study).\\nAmanita areolata T. Oda et al., described from Japan, was suspected to be a synonym of A. zangii (Yang 2005). Phylogenetically, the type of A. areolata fell within the clade of A. zangii with high support (Cai et al. 2014), and the morphological characters of A. areolata are identical to those in A. zangii. Therefore, we treat A. areolata as a synonym of A. zangii. For detailed descriptions, compar- isons with similar species and images of A. zangii see Yang et al. (2001) and Yang (2005, 2015).\\nAmanita sect. Roanokenses Singer ex Singer, Sydowia 15: 67 (1962).\\nSynonym: Amanita subsect. Limbatulae Bas, Persoonia 5: 528 (1969).\\nType: Amanita roanokensis Coker, J. Elisha Mitchell scient. Soc. 43: 141 (1927).\\nDiagnosis: Pileus white, dirty white, grayish, gray to brownish; pileal margin non-striate, appendiculate; lamel- lulae attenuate; stipe with bulbous base; volval remnants often as cones, verrucae, pyramids, powder, floccules to\\n \\npatches on pileal surface and stipe base, occasionally absent on pileus and then leaving a limbate volva on stipe base; annulus membranous to fugacious; basidiospores amyloid; clamps present or absent.\\nCommentary: Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1a, b) indicates that Amanita sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic and clusters in four clades across two subgenera: sect. Lepidella of Amanita subgen. Lepidella; sect. Strobiliformes,  sect.  Phalloideae  and sect. Roanokenses of Amanita subgen. Amanitina. Amanita sect. Roanokenses was proposed by Singer in 1951 but was invalid due to the absence of the Latin diagnosis (Bas 1969; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Singer (1962a) then effec- tively proposed the name of A. sect. Roanokenses Singer, typified by A. roanokensis Coker, and provided a brief Latin diagnosis, 鈥樷楶ileo stipiteque pulvere detersili obtec- tis鈥欌. In this study, 35 species of A. sect.

Roanokenses have white, yellowish to yellow lamellae, while A. avellaneifolia can be easily distin- guished by its biscuit to pale flesh-colored lamellae. Amanita hongoi Bas, described from Japan, is comparable to A. avellaneifolia on account of its similarly colored basidioma. However, A. hongoi has white to yellowish lamellae, a white, dirty white to brownish stipe densely covered with concentrically arranged, minute, concolorous squamules, and clamps are absent in all parts of its basidioma (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2015).\\n102.\\tAmanita brunneostrobilipes Zhu L.

It is associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nPhylogenetically, A. brunneostrobilipes clustered as a distinct clade in A. sect. Roanokenses, away from other species (Fig. 1b). Amanita brunneostrobilipes is similar to\\nA. timida Corner & Bas, a species described from Singa- pore, in the color of the basidioma and recurved squamules on the stipe base. However, the latter can be distinguished by its white pileus with a pinkish tinge, broad ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) and the common presence of clamps (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita brunneostrobilipes is comparable to A. stro- bilipes Thongbai et al. Bin in that they share a strobiliform basal bulb. However, A. strobilipes, described from Thai- land, differs from A. brunneostrobilipes by its darker col- ored (dark gray) cones to pyramids on the pileus, a more appendiculate pileus margin and a non-radicating basal bulb (Li et al. 2016).\\n103.\\tAmanita caojizong Zhu L.

Chiu (1948) used the name 鈥樷楢. manginiana Har. & Pat.鈥欌 for the collections from Yunnan. However, there are some morphological discrepancies between materials from Yunnan, China and the protologue and type illustration (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Therefore, Yang (1997, 2005, 2015) applied the name A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu to document the Chinese materials.\\nIn our current phylogenetic study (Fig. 1b), A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu and A. manginiana clustered as two distinct monophyletic clades. In addition, A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu can be distinguished from A. manginiana by its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., an apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, a thin, white, limbate volva on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a; this study). Thus, we describe A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu here as a novel species. The name A. caojizong is chosen because it is commonly sold in the mushroom markets of Yunnan Province, China as 鈥樷榗aojizong鈥欌.\\n \\n\\n \\nAccording to our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12), six collections, HKAS 38460 (ITS = AY436463) from Yunnan identified as Amanita manginiana sensu W.\\nF. Chiu by Zhang et al. (2004), FB-30951(CBM) (ITS = AB015702) from Japan identified as A. pseudoporphyria by Oda et al. (2002c), SFC20140823-10 (ITS = KT779083) from the Republic of Korea identified as A. manginiana by Cho et al. (2015), BZ-N11 (ITS = KY747457) from Thailand identified as A. cf. manginiana by Thongbai et al. (2017), and A16 (ITS = FJ441046) and A4 (ITS = FJ441034) submitted to NCBI directly as A. pseudoporphyria, should be A. caojizong.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria Hongo and A. pseudo- manginiana Qing Cai et al. can be confused with A. cao- jizong because of their gray-brown pilei and the limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. pseudo- porphyria differs from A. caojizong by its relatively longer basidiospores   (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.5鈥6.0 lm,   Q = 1.27鈥1.7,  Qm = 1.49 卤 0.13), and the volval remnants on the stipe base have fairly abundant, globose, subglobose to fusiform inflated cells (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita pseudo- manginiana can be distinguished with A. caojizong by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 5 cm in diam., a median annulus, a subglobose basal bulb and fairly abundant, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base.\\nAmanita griseoturcosa Oda et al., A. roseolifolia Yang- Yang Cui et al. and A. modesta Corner & Bas are also similar to A. caojizong in their appearance. However, A. griseoturcosa has a smaller basidioma with pileus 4鈥6 cm in diam. and larger basidiospores (8.4鈥12.0 9 5.6鈥7.6 lm, Q = 1.29鈥1.69, Qm = 1.50 卤 0.13) (Oda et al. 2002a; Cho\\net al. 2015).\\nAmanita roseolifolia has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 4鈥7 cm in diam., dirty white lamellae often with a pinkish tinge and relatively larger basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm, Q = 1.32鈥1.57, Qm = 1.45 卤\\n0.09).\\nAmanita modesta has a small basidioma with pileus ca. 4鈥6 cm in diam., a subglobose basal bulb, a thick, fleshy volva on the stipe base with abundant inflated cells and subglobose  to  broadly  ellipsoid  basidiospores  (5.5鈥7.5 9 5.0鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.36, Qm = 1.23 卤\\n0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017).\\n104.\\tAmanita castanopsis Hongo, Bull.

We have examined the holotype of A. grise- ofarinosa from Japan; this specimen includes four half fruiting bodies, which have small basidiomata with pilei ca. 2鈥5 cm in diam., grayish to pallid pilei densely covered with gray to dark gray, tomentose to pulverulent, some- times subconical volval remnants, grayish and farinose stipes ca. 7 cm long 9 0.5 cm diam., no annulus and no clamps.

However, A. cinereovelata differs from A. griseofarinosa in the presence of clamps and in its associations with Shorea robusta trees (Hosen et al. 2015).\\nAmanita griseofarinosa can be easily confused with A. berkeleyi (Hooker f. in Berk.) due to their shared brownish gray basidiomata covered with pulverulent volval remnants over the entire surface of pilus and stipe, and the absence of clamps, but A. berkeleyi differs from A. griseofarinosa by its distinctly larger basidioma and felted-pulverulent, crust- like volval remnants on the pileus often breaking into minute, polygonal patches (Bas 1969). Yang (2015) reported A. berkeleyi from China based on a morphological\\n \\n\\n \\nstudy of the collection HKAS 83447. However, the col- lection is nested in the clade of A. griseofarinosa in the present study (Fig. 2). Thus, we treated this material as A. griseofarinosa.\\n108.\\tAmanita gymnopus Corner & Bas, Persoonia 2(3): 259 (1962).\\nPileus 5.5鈥11 cm in diam., white (1A1), cream (1A2) to brownish (3B2鈥5); volval remnants on pileus patchy to detrital, brownish (3B2鈥5) to brown (4C2鈥5); margin non- striate, appendiculate; trama white (1A1), slowly becoming brownish (3B2鈥5) to brown (4C2鈥5) when injured.

How- ever, A. avellaneifolia has granular to conical, dirty white, grayish white to dark gray volval remnants on the pileus, biscuit-colored lamellae, a white trama without color change when cut, verrucose volval remnants on the stipe base, and shorter basidiospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.07鈥1.35, Qm = 1.2 卤 0.08). Amanita  rubiginosa  has a gray to brownish pileus covered with truncate-\\n \\n\\n \\npyramidal, verrucose to subconical volval remnants, which are gray but sometimes white at the apical part, a white trama without color change when cut, a gray basal bulb often with a reddish tinge covered with verrucose to sub- conical  squamules,  and  shorter   basidiospores   (8.0鈥10.0  9 6.5鈥8.0 lm,   Q  = 1.15鈥1.43,    Qm  = 1.29 卤\\n0.72). Amanita pyramidata has pyramidal to verrucose volval remnants on the pileus, a white trama without color change when cut, verrucose to conical volval remnants on the  stipe  base,  relatively  broader  basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 7.5鈥9.5,  Q = 1.1鈥1.27,  Qm = 1.18 卤 0.06),\\nand is found in subalpine forests with Abies and Picea.\\nAmanita luteofolia is similar to A. gymnopus. However,\\nA. gymnopus differs from A. luteofolia by its smaller, globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores and a white stipe base lacking volval remnants (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Hongo 1974a; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017).\\nAmanita luteofolia is similar to A. pannosa, a novel species described in this study. However, A. pannosa has patchy to fragmental, removable, brownish volval rem- nants on the pileus and relatively smaller basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥6.5 lm).\\nAmanita ochrophylla (Cooke & Massee) Cleland is also comparable to A. luteofolia. However, A. ochrophylla, described from Australia, has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus 9鈥17 (鈥24) cm, non-removable volval remnants on the pileus and a second ring inside the upper ring on the middle or lower part of stipe (Bas 1969; Reid 1980; Wood 1997).\\n114.\\tAmanita macrocarpa W.

Yang 6079 (HKAS 101268).\\nCommentary: The concept of A. manginiana Har. & Pat., a species described by Hariot and Patouillard (1914) from Vietnam, was unclear, because the type is not in good condition for either phylogenetic or morphological study (Gilbert 1941a; Yang 1997). Fortunately, we have col- lected a specimen (HKAS 101268) similar to A. mangini- ana from Vietnam, which has been included in our study. Our current multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) indicates that the Vietnamese specimen (HKAS 101268) clusters within the monophyletic Chinese clade with 100% statistical support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of specimens are consistent with the protologue and type illustration of A. manginiana, except for the absence of the yellowish pileal margin (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Consequently, we treat specimens in this clade as A. manginiana for the present.\\nAmanita manginiana is characterized by its relatively small basidioma with a pileus ca. 5鈥8 cm in diam., a median, thick, persistent annulus, a thick, gray, limbate volva on the stipe base with the inner part composed of abundant to nearly dominant, globose, subglobose, ellip- soid to clavate inflated cells, and ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.7鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.38鈥1.6, Qm = 1.49 卤\\n0.01).\\nAmanita manginiana is similar to A. caojizong, which was treated as A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu in Yang\\n \\n(1997, 2005, 2015) and described as a novel species in this study. However, A. caojizong differs from A. manginiana in its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., the apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, thin, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells.\\nAmanita pseudomanginiana can be confused with A. manginiana in that they share medium-sized basidiomata with gray-brown to brown pilei, median annuli, limbate volval remnants on the stipe base and mostly ellipsoid basidiospores. However, A. pseudomanginiana differs from\\nA. manginiana in its relatively slender basidioma, a thin annulus attached on the middle part of stipe surface, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base with fairly abundant to abundant inflated cells, which are mostly ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria is similar to A. manginiana, but the former has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 cm in diam., an apical, large, fragile annulus, and a thin, white volva on the stipe base with fairly abundant inflated cells (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; see below).\\nAmanita modesta, A. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia are also comparable to A. manginiana in their gray pilei and limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. modesta has a large, apical annulus, a white volva on the stipe  base  and  relatively   smaller   basidiospores  (5.5鈥7.5  9 5.0鈥6.0 lm,     Q  = 1.1鈥1.36,    Qm  =  1.23 卤\\n0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017).

It is characterized by its gray pileus covered with pyramidal volval remnants, a distinctly radicating stipe base with its upper part covered with inconspicuous volval remnants, ellipsoid basidiospores (8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), the pres- ence of clamps and occurrence in temperate forests.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), A. miculifera was recognized as two phylogenetic species (HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425) based on PTP analy- sis. Because only subtle morphological differences were observed between HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425 (ba- sidiospores   for   HKAS   100515   are   [150/3/1] 8.5鈥11.0  9 5.5鈥7.0 lm,  Q =  1.3鈥1.7,   Qm  = 1.5 卤 0.09;\\nbasidiospores  for  HKAS  101425  are  [20/1/1]   8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.32鈥1.6, Qm = 1.47 卤 0.08),\\nwe treat them as a single species, A. miculifera, which is also supported by GCPSR analysis (Fig. 2).\\nOur ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that\\nA. miculifera is closely related to A. cf. vestita. However, a specimen of A. cf. vestita (HKAS 80175) listed under A. vestita, has a non-radicating basal bulb and no clamps.\\n \\nAmanita miculifera can be confused with A. onusta (Howe) Sacc., but the latter differs in its relatively larger and darker colored pyramids on the pileus, dark gray to brownish gray, warted or recurred volval remnants on the stipe base often arranged in rings, and a less prominently radicating stipe base (Bas 1969; Bas and Hatanaka 1984; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita japonica is morphologically similar to A. miculifera in its gray pileus, a more or less radicating stipe base and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores. However, A. japonica has pyramidal to floccose volval remnants on the pileus and a napiform stipe base slightly radicating, lacking distinct pesudorhiza (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014). In China, A. heishidingensis is compa- rable to A. miculifera in its gray pileus covered with pyramidal volval remnants. However, A. heishidingensis has paler volval remnants on the pileus and a napiform stipe base not distinctly radicating. In addition, A. heishidingensis occurs in early spring (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015).\\n117.\\tAmanita minutisquama Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang, sp. nov.\\nFigures 37l, m, 43.

It is found in tropical forests.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), HKAS 100504 and HKAS 101425 split into two subclades based on PTP analysis. Since only subtle morphological and ecological differences were found to separate them, we treat them as a single species, A.minutisquama. No closely related species of A. minutisquama were uncovered in our current study (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita virginea Massee and A. virgineoides are similar to A. minutisquama in their white basidiomata, conical volval remnants often arranged in incomplete belts on stipe base, and the presence of clamps. However, A. virginea has relatively larger conical volval remnants on the pileus (up to 4 mm in height and 3 mm in width), a more globose basal bulb at the stipe base, and broader basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.3) (Corner and  Bas\\n1962; Bas 1969; Lee 2017). Amanita virgineoides has an ovoid to fusiform stipe base, a large, apical annulus with a verrucose lower surface, and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Yang 1997, 2000,\\n2005, 2015; see below).\\n \\nAmanita brunneostrobilipes, a novel species described in this study, can be confused with A. minutisquama because of their shared white basidiomata and similar habitats.

This species has been traditionally put into A. sect. Amidella based on morphological data (Hongo 1982; Tulloss et al. 1992a; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b)  indicates   that   it   actually   belongs   in   A. sect. Roanokenses and is related to A. pseudomanginiana,\\nA. pseudoporphyria and A. atrobrunnea Thongbai et al.\\nIndeed, its inflated stipe base and limbate volva suggest that it is a member of A. sect. Roanokenses. However, the latter three species have a dark brown, gray-brown to gray pileus and white to whitish limbate volval remnants on the stipe base (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016). In addition, A. pseudomanginiana has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 5 cm in diam, while A. atrobrunnea has a broad umbo on the pileal center and a pileipellis composed of radically arranged filamentous hyphae with inflated termi- nal cells (Li et al. 2016).

This species was initially treated as a lethal amanita of A. sect. Phalloideae (Yang and Doi 1999; Yang and Li 2001; Yang 2005). However, phylogenetic evidence, coupled with the absence of amatoxins and phallotoxins, and its fresh basidioma lacking a yellow reaction to 5% KOH solution suggested it belonged to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (Cai et al. 2014). Amanita oberwinklerana is poisonous and can cause acute renal failure (Fu et al. 2017).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2), spec- imens labeled as A. oberwinkerana split into two closely related subclades (the HKAS 80150 subclade and the HKAS 100611 subclade) based on GCPSR analysis. However, no distinct and stable morphological differences were found to exist between the specimens in these two subclades. Thus, we treat them as a single species, A. oberwinkerana. Ecologically, species from the HKAS 80150 clade are found in central, eastern, southern and southeastern China, while those from the HKAS 100611 clade are mainly found in central and northeastern China. These two subclades may represent different geographic populations of A. oberwinkerana. Its phylogenetically related species are as yet unknown (Fig. 1b).

Indeed, they are also similar in morphological appearance. However, A. heishidingensis has relatively larger verrucae (ca. 1鈥6 mm in height and 1鈥6 mm in width) on the pileus, cream lamellae lacking a greenish tinge and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Li and Cai\\n2014; Yang 2015).\\nThe grayish to gray basidioma, the verrucae on the pileus and the non-radicating basal bulb of A. palli- dochlorotica are also reminiscent of A. japonica and A. griseoverrucosa Zhu L. Yang. However, A. japonica dif- fers from A. pallidochlorotica in that its lamellae lack a greenish tinge and it has a fusiform basal bulb (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014). Amanita griseoverrucosa, a species previously in A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969), but transferred to A. sect. Strobiliformes in this study, differs from A. pallidochlorotica in its white lamellae lacking a greenish tinge, relatively larger basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) and the absence of\\nclamps (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015).\\nThe European species A. solitaria (Bull.: Fr.) Fr. is also comparable to A. pallidochlorotica in the greenish lamel- lae. However, A. solitaria can be easily distinguished by its distinctly larger basidiospores (9.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm)\\n(Gilbert 1940; Bas 1969; Contu 2000a; Yang 2015).\\nOther species in A. sect. Roanokenses that are compa- rable to A. pallidochlorotica, in that they share a gray pileus with volval remnants on its surface often appearing as conical to warted particles, are A. griseofarinosa and A. vestita. However, A. griseofarinosa has white lamellae, a clavate to ventricose basal bulb with the upper part covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants, broader basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) and no clamps (Bas  1969;  Imazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Yang   1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita vestita has a smaller basidioma, white lamellae and no clamps (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n122.\\tAmanita pannosa Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu\\nL.

It grows in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Picea and Abies.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis (Figs. 1b, S12), A. pyra- midata is related to A. rubiginosa Cai et al., A. avel- laneifolia Yang et al. and A. magniverrucata Thiers & Ammirati. However, A. rubiginosa has a basal bulb often with a reddish tinge, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8,  Q = 1.15  鈥1.43,  Qm = 1.29\\n卤 0.72) and forms associations with Castanopsis, Litho- carpus, Quercus and Pinus. Amanita avellaneifolia has a dirty white to cream pileus with granular to conical volval remnants, biscuit colored lamellae, and forms association with Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis. Amanita magniver- rucata has a slender basidioma, a relatively pale pileus, volval remnants on the pileus that are at first a thick and rather smooth covering over the entire pileus, becoming areolate and later appearing as larger conspicuous pyra- midal warts, and relatively narrower basidiospores (8.0鈥12.6  9 5.8鈥8.0  lm)   (Thiers   and   Ammirati 1982;\\nTulloss 2009).\\nThe size and form of basidiospores of A. pyramidata is comparable to A. berkeleyi and A. eriophora (Berk.) E.\\nJ. Gilbert, both described from India (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar     et al. 1990). However, clamps are absent in the two Indian species (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990). Furthermore, A. berkeleyi develops a gray to gray-brown pileus bearing felted-pulverulent, crust-like volval remnants (Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990), while A. eriophora possesses a stipe covered with grayish lilac, floccose-felted volval remnants (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990).\\n127.\\tAmanita roseolifolia Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

In China, A. roseolifolia was misidentified as A. griseoturcosa by Yang (2015). However, these two species can be separated both by phylogenetic and morphological evidence. Our ITS phy- logenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that the holotype of\\nA. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia fell into two distinct clades. In addition, A. griseotucosa can be morphologically distinguished from A. roseolifolia by its gray pileus with a turquoise tinge, white lamellae and a limbate volva often appressed to stipe (Oda et al. 2002c; Cho et al. 2015).\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria and A. caojizong are similar to A. roseolifolia in appearance.

However, the latter can be easily distinguished by its dirty white to cream pileus covered with small granular to conical, dirty white to grayish white squamules and biscuit to flesh-colored lamellae.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita rubiginosa is similar to A. japonica in its medium-sized basidioma, and gray pileus densely covered with grayish truncate-pyramidal verrucose to subconical squamules. However, A. japonica possesses a fusiform- rooting to subclavate basal bulb covered with floccose- pulverulent volval remnants, a non-gelatinized pileipellis and relatively narrower basidiospores (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014).\\nAmanita rubiginosa resembles A. heishidingensis in appearance (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015). However, A. heishidingensis has a relatively larger and paler (dirty white to whitish) basidioma, and a subclavate to ventricose basal bulb covered with pale yellow to pale brownish gray, subfelty to subtomentose volval remnants (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015).

Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not suggest any species closely related to A. sphaerobulbosa.\\nAmanita sphaerobulbosa is similar to the North Amer- ican species A. abrupta Peck, however, A. abrupta has narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Bas\\n1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; Yang and Doi 1999). Furthermore, the apical part of the warts on the pileus of A. sphaerobulbosa has many vascular hyphae and inflated cells, which is not the case in A. abrupta (Bas 1969; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nAmanita sphaerobulbosa is comparable to A. kotohi- raensis, but the latter has felted to patch-like volval rem- nants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements, a fragile and fugacious annulus, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), and a pungent odor (Nagasawa and Mitani 2000; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).

Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. vestita is related to A. cinereovelata Hosen and A. griseofarinosa. They are morphologically similar. How- ever, A. cinereovelata is found in Shorea forests and differs from A. vestita in its globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.0鈥10.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) and the presence of clamps (Hosen et al. 2015). Amanita griseofarinosa has a relatively larger basidioma and  broader  basidiospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo\\n1987; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Ima- zeki et al. 2011).\\nMorphologically, A. vestita is very similar to A. cf. vestita. Furthermore, the specimen of A. cf. vestita (HKAS 80175) has a small pileus ca. 3 cm diam., gray, floccose volval remnants on the pileus forming verrucae at the center; a non-radicating basal bulb with its upper part covered with irregularly arranged, felty, floccose to coni- cal, white to grayish squamules, ellipsoid basidiospores measuring [200/4/2] (7.0鈥) 8.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 (鈥8.0) lm,\\nQ = (1.27鈥) 1.33鈥1.67 (鈥1.75), Qm = 1.50 卤 0.10 and no\\nclamps. Because of the limited number of available spec- imens of A. cf. vestita, and because few morphological differences were observed between A. vestita and A. cf. vestita, the classification of A. cf. vestita will be postponed until more collections are available for study.\\n133.\\tAmanita virgineoides Bas, Persoonia 5 (3): 435 (1969).\\nPileus 7鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., white (1A1); volval remnants on pileus pyramidal, ca. 1鈥3 mm in height and 1鈥3 mm in width, white (1A1); margin non-striate, appendiculate; trama white (1A1), unchanging.

Lepi- della sensu Bas, based on morphological data (Bas 1969). However, our molecular phylogenetic analysis indicate that\\nA. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic, and A. strobiliformis and its allies represent a distinct clade sister to A. sect. Validae with relatively high support (Fig. 1a, b). In addition, species in this clade share common characters\\n \\nmentioned above in the diagnosis, and we therefore treat it as a distinct section. Amanita sect. Strobiliformes was proposed by Singer in 1951. However, it was invalid due to the absence of a Latin diagnosis. Three species from China were uncovered in our phylogenetic analyses, including two novel and one known species.\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

Yang 5734 [HKAS 80014,\\nidentified as Amanita griseoverrucosa in Yang (2015)].\\nCommentary: Amanita aspericeps is characterized by its medium-sized to large basidioma, a dirty white, grayish to gray pileus covered with gray verrucae that are often white to whitish in their apical part, a subapical annulus, a ven- tricose stipe base with its lower part slightly radicating, broadly ellipsoid, ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (8.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm), the absence of clamps and its occurrence in subtropical forests dominated by Fagaceae, occasionally mixed with Pinaceae.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the spec- imens putatively assigned to a new species split into two subclades (HKAS 77783-HKAS 101391-HKAS 78435\\nsubclade and HKAS 80014-HKAS 100519 subclade) and were recognized as two phylogenetic species based on both GCPSR and PTP analyses. However, no obvious morpho- logical and ecological differences were observed between species in these clades, according to our current study. Consequently, we treat them here as a single species, described here under the name A. aspericeps.\\nAmanita aspericeps is phylogenetically sister and mor- phologically similar to A. cinereoradicata Yang-Yang Cui et al. (Fig. 1b). However, the latter differs from A. aspericeps in its larger basidioma and longer basidiospores (9.5鈥11.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Yuan and Sun 1995; Yang\\n1997, 2005, 2015; see below). Furthermore, A. cinereo- radicata is dominant in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Abies or Picea  (Yuan  and  Sun  1995;  Yang  1997, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nAmanita griseoverrucosa is very similar to A. aspericeps in appearance. However, A. griseoverrucosa has a paler (dirty  white)  pileus  and  an  apical  annulus  (Yang   2004, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nSpecies in A. sect. Roanokenses that share a gray pileus and are comparable to A. aspericeps include A. griseofari- nosa, A. berkeleyi, A. vestita, A. pallidochlorotica and A. cinereoconia G. F. Atk. However, A. griseofarinosa has tomentose, floccose to pulverulent volval remnants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements, a stipe\\n \\ndensely covered with tomentose to pulverulent squamules and    relatively    broader    basidiospores    (8.0鈥10.0  9\\n6.0鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang\\n1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita berkeleyi has a relatively larger basidioma with a pileus ca. 12.5鈥17.5 cm in diam., crust-like volval remnants on the pileus sometimes breaking into minute, polygonal patches, and relatively broader basidiospores (8鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990). Amanita vestita has a relatively smaller basidioma with a pileus ca. 3鈥5 cm in diam., and brownish volval remnants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita palli- dochlorotica can be distinguished from A. aspericeps by its cream lamellae with a greenish tinge, smaller basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.5鈥6.0 lm) and the presence of clamps. Amanita cinereoconia, a species described from the USA, has a relatively smaller basidioma with a pileus ca. 3鈥7 cm in diam. and narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥10.9 9 4.7鈥6.2 lm)\\n(Coker   1917;  Gilbert   1940,   1941a;  Bas  1969; Jenkins\\n1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\n136.\\tAmanita cinereoradicata Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L.

It is found in subalpine forests together with Abies or Picea.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. cinereoradicata is closely related to A. aspericeps. For comparisons between A. cinereoradicata and A. aspericeps see the commentary on A. aspericeps.\\nYuan and Sun (1995) applied the name 鈥樷楢. cinere- opannosa鈥欌 to the Chinese materials.

However, phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is a species of A. sect. Strobiliformes (Fig. 1b). Our phyloge- netic and morphological studies revealed that the material given the name A. griseoverrucosa (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015) in fact harbored two distinct species.

It is predominantly associated with broad- leaved trees.\\nOur ITS phylogenetic study (Fig. S14) showed that A. brunneolimbata was closely related to the North American\\nA. brunnescens G. F. Atk. Indeed, these two species are morphologically similar to each other in their reddish often longitudinally splitting basal bulb with a short limbate or collar-like, dirty white to brownish to brown volva. How- ever, A. brunnescens has a relatively robuster basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus often covered with white to pale ocheraceous, floccose patches and is associated with mixed forests (Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita citrina var. grisea (Hongo) Hongo can be confused with A. brunneolimbata because of the similar colors of their basidiomata. However, our phylogenetic data (Fig. S14) indicate that they represent two distinct species, and A. citrina var. grisea differs from A. brun- neolimbata by its non-umbonate pileus, yellow volval remnants on the pileus, and  yellow  annulus  (Hongo  1958, 1959; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; this study). HKAS 79025, treated as A. citrina var. grisea in Yang (2015), is clearly A. brunneolimbata according on our data.\\n139.\\tAmanita citrina Pers., Tent. disp. meth. fung.

This species is characterized by its yellow pileus covered with felted to patchy, yellow to yellowish, removable volval remnants, a yellow annulus, a marginate basal bulb, globose to subglobose basidiospores (7.0鈥8.5 9 6.5鈥8.0 lm) and the absence of clamps.\\n \\nOur ITS data (Fig. S14) indicate that samples from Denmark, France, Germany and South Korea cluster as a clade and are the true A. citrina. HKAS 34170 (ITS = AY436449), which was identified as A. citrina in Yang (2005), did not fall within the A. citrina clade, and was supported as a separate divergent lineage, it may represent a new taxon. However, the classification of HKAS 34170 needs further investigation including more collections as the condition of this single specimen is poor. We were unfortunately unable to generate DNA sequences from the specimens of Chinese A. citrina.\\nAmanita citrina var. grisea was described as a form under A. citrina in Hongo (1958), and then treated as a variety under A. citrina in Hongo (1959). We have exam- ined the holotype of A. citrina var. grisea. It is character- ized by its small grayish brown pileus, a marginate basal bulb with a short, white, dirty white to pale ocheraceous volval limb, a subapical annulus, and globose to subglo- bose   basidiospores   [30/2/1]   (7.5鈥)   8.0鈥9.5   (鈥10.0)  9\\n7.0鈥9.0 lm,  Q = (1.0鈥)   1.02鈥1.14,   Qm = 1.07 卤 0.04.\\nOda et al. (1999) provided an ITS sequence (AB015680) of\\nA. citrina var. grisea from a Japanese specimen (LEM 970501) collected near the type locality. Furthermore, samples of A. citrina and A. citrina var. grisea clustered as two  separate  clades  without  any  close  relationship  (Fig. S14), thus, A. citrina var. grisea should probably be treated as a distinct species when more specimens become available for study.\\nIn China, Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2015) reported\\nA. citrina var. grisea based on the collections HKAS 32506 and HKAS 79025 respectively. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that HKAS 79025 should belong to A. brun- neolimbata. The classification of HKAS 32506 needs fur- ther investigation including more collections as the condition of this single specimen is poor.\\n140.\\tAmanita citrinoannulata Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai  & Zhu L.

It is noteworthy that the color of A. citrinoannulata is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, brown, grayish brown to dark brown.\\nPhylogenetically, A. citrinoannulata is closely related and morphologically similar to the European species A. spissa (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Fig. 1b). However, A. spissa differs from A. citrinoannulata in its robust basidioma, a gray pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking snakeskin-like, yellow squamules, white to dirty white volval remnants on the stipe base and a white annulus (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015). Furthermore, the reddish discoloration following bruising of A. spissa only occurs on the stipe surface, while in A. citrinoannulata the discoloration can occur over all\\n \\n\\n \\nparts of the basidioma (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J.\\nE. Lange and A. flavorubens (Berk. & Mont.) Sacc. are morphologically similar to A. citrinoannulata in that they share basidiomata with red discoloration on bruising, and yellow annuli. However, A. rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J. E. Lange has a grayish brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking yel- low, snakeskin-like squamules, and an inflated basal bulb glabrous or covered with dirty white, grayish to brown volval remnants (Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita flavorubens has a brown to yellow pileus covered with patchy, lemon yellow volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores (9.4鈥10.2 9 6.2鈥7.0 lm) (Atkinson 1902; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAdditional species in A. sect. Validae sharing basid- iomata with more or less red discoloration when bruised include A. orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N. Lakh., A. rubescens Pers. and A. excelsa (Fr.: Fr.) Bertillon. However, A. orsonii and A. rubescens have a brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a dirty white to grayish stipe lacking yellow squamules above the annulus, and a white annulus often with a reddish tinge (Gilbert 1940; Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss et al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa, a species described from Sweden, has a robust basidioma with a red tinge only occurring at the stipe base, a white stipe lacking yellow squamules, and a white to dirty white annulus (Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Poumarat 2004).\\nBasidiomata of A. citrinoannulata with a gray-brown to gray pileus are also comparable to those of A. fritillaria Sacc. and A. spissacea S. Imai. However, the basidiomata of the latter two species do not change color when injured (Imai  1933,  1938;  Hongo  1959;  Corner  and  Bas  1962;\\nImazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988,  2011;\\nKumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015). Furthermore, A. fritillaria has a white to dirty white stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, a basal bulb covered with conical, verrucose to floccose, blackish, dark gray to gray- brown volval remnants and a dirty white to gray annulus (Corner and Bas 1962; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang  2005, 2015; this study). Amanita spissacea possesses a dirty white to gray stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, pulverulent to floccose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants on the stipe base, a grayish annulus and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Imazeki and\\nHongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; this study).\\n \\n141.\\tAmanita citrinoindusiata Zhu L.

The low genetic divergence was found between A. flavipes and A. augusta, not only in ITS but also in the other gene fragments used in this study, is due to their recent divergence from their most recent common ancestor (around 7 Mya, our unpublished data). Morphologically, A. augusta differs from A. flavipes in its dark brown, brown to yellow-brown pileus and a subglo- bose basal bulb with a distinct rufescent tinge in age (Bojantchev and Davis 2013).

It is predominantly associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S14), HKAS 38419 (ITS = AY436474), which was identified as Amanita sp. 1 in Zhang et al. (2004), clustered within A. flavosquamosa with strong support (MLB = 100%). Therefore, we assign HKAS 38419 to A. flavosquamosa. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. flavosquamosa (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can be confused with A. detersa because of the color and form of the basidiomata, and the volval remnants on the pileus. However, A. detersa pos- sesses a relatively slender basidioma, a thinner but not fragile annulus, pulverulent yellow volval remnants on the stipe base  and  relatively  smaller  basidiospores (7.0鈥8.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is similar to A. flavipes in appearance, but the latter differs by its yellower basidioma and slightly narrower basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥\\n7.0 lm) (Imai 1933; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Tulloss et al. 2001).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is also similar to A. franchetii. However, A. franchetii has a robuster basidioma, firmer volval remnants, and broad ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Contu 2000a; Galli\\n2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can also be confused with the North American A. augusta, but the latter differs in its yellow annulus, basal bulb distinctly rufescent in age and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥9.3 9 6.0鈥6.8 lm, Q = 1.27鈥1.57) (Bojantchev and Davis 2013).\\n145.\\tAmanita fritillaria Sacc. f. fritillaria, Syll. fung.

Chiu (1948) reported A. fritillaria from China, however, the concept of this species was not clear until a detailed study and description of the type was published by Corner and Bas (1962). Amanita fritillaria is characterized by its dark gray to gray pileus covered with conical to floc- cose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants, a subglobose\\n \\n\\n \\nbasal bulb with its upper part covered with conical to floc- cose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants arranged in belts or incomplete rings, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm, Q = 1.15鈥1.38, Qm =\\n1.27 卤 0.07) and the absence of clamps.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), HKAS 32517, which was determined as A. pilosella Corner & Bas in Yang (1997, 2005) and Wei脽 et al. (1998), clustered within the A. fritillaria clade and should be considered A. fritillaria. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) also indicates that A. fritillaria is sister to\\nA. fuscosquamosa A. E. Wood, but the latter differs in its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus up to 5 cm in diam., prominent flat brown scales on the pileus and a brown annulus (Wood 1997).\\nAmanita spissacea was treated as a synonym of A. fritillaria in Yang (1997, 2005, 2015). However, our phy- logenetic and morphological data indicate that they should be considered two distinct species, and details of this are presented in the commentary on A. spissacea.\\nAmanita fritillaria also is somewhat similar to A. excelsa and A. spissa. However, specimens of A. excelsa from Germany have relatively robust basidiomata that are lighter in color (dirty white to grayish), removable volval remnants on the pileus, lighter colored stipes (white to grayish), and white to dirty white basal bulbs often with a red tinge. To date, A. excelsa has not been found  in  China. Specimens of A. spissa from China and Europe, which are listed in specimens examined under A. spissa, differ from A. fritillaria in their patchy, gray, brownish to dirty white volval remnants on the pileus and paler stipes (dirty white to grayish) often with a red tinge. In China,\\nA. spissa has only been found in the northeastern regions (see below).\\n146.\\tAmanita fritillaria f. malayensis Corner & Bas, Persoonia 2(3): 266 (1962).\\nBasidiospores [70/4/4] 6.5鈥8.0 9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥7.0 (鈥7.5)\\nlm,  Q = (1.03鈥)  1.08鈥1.20  (鈥1.23);  Q = 1.13 卤  0.05,\\nsubglobose to broadly ellipsoid, amyloid, colorless, thin- walled, smooth; apiculus small.\\nHabitat: Solitary to scattered in tropical to subtropical broad-leaved forests; basidioma occurring in summer and autumn.\\nDistribution: Known from eastern, southern and south- western China (Yang 1997, 2005; this study), Malaysia (Lee 2017) and Singapore (Corner and Bas 1962).\\nSpecimens examined: CHINA.

It is putatively associated with tropical to sub- tropical broad-leaved trees.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. innatifibrilla (Fig. 1b). Amanita pilosella is morphologically similar to A. innati- fibrilla in the small basidioma and the size and form of the basidiospores, but A. pilosella has a darker pileus (fuligi- nous to grayish brown), powdery-subvillose, fuliginous or blackish volval remnants on the pileus forming a thin\\n \\n\\n \\nscurfy-pruinose covering or irregular warts, and a darker stipe (fuscous-gray to fuscous) (Corner and Bas 1962). Amanita demissa Corner & Bas can be confused with A. innatifibrilla because of their small basidiomata, but the former differs from the latter in its darker pileus (grayish umber), and larger, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores (6.4鈥8.5 9 4.7鈥6.4 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962). Amanita fritillaria f. malayensis is also comparable to A. innatifibrilla because of the similar size and form of the basidiospores. However, A. fritillaria f. malayensis has a larger basidioma and a darker pileus (dark brown) (Corner and Bas 1962).\\n148.\\tAmanita orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N.

Indeed, they are morphologically similar in their basidiomata changing to reddish when bruised or injured. However, A. orsonii has slightly shorter basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) and has a more southern distributed (Kumar et al. 1990; Tulloss et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita brunneocularis, a species described from Colombia, has gray to black volval remnants on the pileus, a white stipe densely covered with dark gray or blackish fibrils and an annulus with a gray lower surface, and a distribution in Central America and Colombia (Tulloss et al. 1992b). Amanita novinupta has a white pileus before discoloration, volval remnants on the pileus occasionally appearing as soft, cottony patches and presence of clamps (Tulloss and Lindgren 1994). Amanita flavorubescens has a bright yellow to yellow brown pileus, a yellow annulus and yellow volval remnants on the pileus and on the stipe base (Atkinson 1902; Murrill 1913; Jenkins 1982, 1986).\\n152.\\tAmanita sepiacea S.

JAPAN. HOKKAIDO: Nopporo, altitude unknown, 10 October 1926, S. Imai (TYPE).\\nCommentary: Imai (1933) described A. sepiacea from Japan without assignment of a type. Hongo (1959) desig- nated a type for the species; it was collected by S. Imai from Nopporo, Hokkaido on 10 October 1926. We exam- ined the type and found that most basidiospores had col- lapsed, and only a few basidiospores could be measured.

Since morphological differences between them were only subtle, we consider them to be a single species, A. sepiacea. No closely related species of A. sepiacea were detected in our current study (Fig. 1b).

However, our molecular phylogenetic data indicate that these should be two distinct species, lacking a close relationship (Fig. 1b). Amanita spissa is probably widely distributed throughout Eurasia, but in China has only been found in the northeastern (Yang 2015; Fig. 2).\\nPhylogenetically, A. spissa is related to A. citrinoannu- lata (Fig. 1b), and a comparison between these two species is presented in the commentary on A. citrinoannulata. The red-color change on the stipe of A. spissa is comparable to that in A. orsonii and A. rubescens. However, in the latter two species, all parts of the basidiomata color red when\\n \\n\\n \\ninjured, and all have a lighter colored pileus (Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss\\net al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. rubescens is found in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and central, northern, northwestern and southwestern regions of China (Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study), while A. orsonii is found in India, Japan and central, eastern and southwestern regions of China (Kumar et al. 1990; Tulloss et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\n155.\\tAmanita spissacea S.

Yang 5556 (HKAS 71041).\\nCommentary: Although Imai (1933, 1938) reported that the basidiospores of A. spissacea were globose and 7鈥8 lm, Gilbert (1940) showed that the basidiospores are broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid and occasionally subglobose. Yang (1997) has examined the type of this taxon and found that the basidiospores were [35/1] (6.5鈥) 7.0鈥9.5 (鈥11.0) 9\\n5.5鈥7.5 (鈥8.5) lm, Q = (1.08鈥) 1.15鈥1.33 (鈥1.39), Qm =\\n1.24 卤 0.06, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, rarely subglo- bose, amyloid, colorless, thin-walled and smooth.\\nBased on the study of the type, Yang (1997) suggested that A. spissacea is probably a synonym of A. fritillaria because only limited morphological differences were observed between the two taxa. However, our current study with both phylogenetic and morphological evidence indi- cates that A. fritillaria and A. spissacea should be two distinct species (Fig. 1b). Phylogenetically, A. fritillaria and A. spissacea cluster as two distinct lineages (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, HKAS 71041, which was collected in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan near the type locality and matches well with the characters of A. spissacea, clustered within the A. spissacea clade (Fig. S14). Amanita spissacea differs from A. fritillaria in its felted volval remnants on the pileus and pulverulent to floccose volval remnants on the stipe base (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Corner and Bas 1962; Imazeki and Hongo 1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988, 2011; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Based on broad sampling, we have also found that\\nA. fritillaria and A. spissacea have minute differences in the forms of their basidiospores, which can easily be overlooked. Amanita fritillaria has broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm, Q = 1.15鈥1.38, Qm = 1.27 卤 0.07), while A. spissacea has subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.08鈥1.3, Qm = 1.2 卤 0.08). Neverthe- less, multiple characters should be used when determining these taxa. HKAS 29511 was regarded as A. fritillaria in Wei脽 et al. (1998), but fell within the A. spissacea clade in our nrLSU analysis (data not shown).\\nAmanita spissacea is also morphologically comparable to A. sepiacea, A. excelsa and A. spissa. However, A. sepiacea differs from A. spissacea in the conical to ver- rucose, white to dirty white volval remnants on the pileus\\n \\n\\n \\nand on the stipe base, a lighter stipe (white to dirty white), a large, apical, white to dirty white annulus and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm,\\nQ = 1.15鈥1.45,  Qm = 1.29 卤  0.14)  (Imai  1933,  1938;\\nGilbert 1941a; Hongo 1959; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa and A. spissa can be distinguished from A. spissacea by their lighter colored pileus (gray, grayish, brown to brownish) covered with lighter colored volval remnants (gray, grayish to dirty white), a grayish to white stipe often with a red tinge, dirty white volval rem- nants on the stipe base and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores   (8.0鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥7.5 lm,  Q = 1.2鈥1.53,\\nQm = 1.36 卤 0.08 for A. excela; 7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm,\\nQ = 1.15鈥1.35, Qm = 1.25 卤 0.07 for A. spissa) (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach and Kra篓nzlin 1995; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015; this study).\\nAmanita  subgen.

Mycol.: 38 (1926)\\nType: Amanita vittadinii (Moretti) Vittad., Tent. mycol.\\nAmanit. illustr.: 31 (1826).\\nCommentary: This subgenus comprises a single section, namely A. sect. Lepidella. For the diagnosis of the subgenus see that of the A. sect. Lepidella below. Beauseigneur (1926) listed his subgenus as 鈥樷楲epidella Gilbert鈥欌 with a direct ref- erence 鈥樷(Bull. Soc. myc. Tome XLI 2e fascicule 1925)鈥欌. Because Gilbert (1925) had it as a generic name, and one that proved to be illegitimate because it was a later homonym, it cannot serve as a basionym (Art. 49.1, McNeill et al. 2012). It must therefore be regarded as a replacement name (Art. 7.4) and is to be typified by the type of the replaced name. The type of 鈥樷楲epidella Gilbert鈥欌 by original designation was Agaricus vittadinii. Recently, an epitype was selected for the type species of A. subgen. Lepidella and sect. Lepidella, namely A. vittadinii (Vizzini et al. 2016b).\\nAmanita sect. Lepidella Corner & Bas, Persoonia 2: 244 (1962)\\nType: Amanita vittadinii (Moretti) Vittad., Tent. mycol.\\nAmanit. illustr.: 31 (1826)\\nDiagnosis: Basidioma saprotrophic; volval remnants on pileus conical, verrucose to floccose, composed of chains of subcylindrical to elongate-fusiform to ellipsoid cells; stipe elongate, subcylindrical to narrowly clavate; volval remnants scattered over the surface of stipe; basidiospores amyloid, mostly subglobose, broadly ellipsoid to elongate. Clamps present.\\nCommentary: Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that\\nA. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic (Mon- calvo et al. 2002; Justo et al. 2010; Wolfe et al. 2012), and the\\nA. subsect. Vittadiniae Bas (1969) emend. Tulloss et al. (2016) represents a distinct clade, which was treated as a genus, Aspidella or Saproamanita by Vizzini et al. (2012)\\n \\nand Redhead et al. (2016). In our study, we treat this clade as a section under Amanita, A. sect. Lepidella, for the following three reasons: 1) in our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1a, b), this clade was only moderately supported as a monophyletic group (MLB = 77%), but it was closely rela- ted to the remaining clades of Amanita as monophyletic with strong support (MLB = 97%), and was also supported in the ITS phylogenetic analysis of Vizzini et al. (2012) with MLB = 100% and BPP = 1; 2) morphologically, the agari- coid and sequestrate taxa in Amanita s.l. (the monophyly contained this clade, A. subgen. Amanita and A. subgen. Amanitina) have a schizohymenial ontogeny in their devel- opment (Reijnders 1963; Bas 1969; Yang and Oberwinkler 1999; Tulloss et al. 2016); 3) to maintain the nomenclatural stability of Amanita, we prefer to treat this clade as part of the genus Amanita and use the oldest available subgeneric and sectional names for it, although the context of the subgenus and section has been changed dramatically in comparison with that of Bas (1969), which seems, unfortunate, but unavoidable. The remaining species should be assigned to Amanita subgenus Amanitina, including its sect. Strobili- formes, sect. Phalloideae and sect. Roanokenses.\\nTo date, only a single species of A. sect. Lepidella, A. flavofloccosa Nagas. & Hongo, has been found in China.\\n156.\\tAmanita flavofloccosa Nagas. & Hongo, Trans. Mycol. Soc.

However, A. subglobosa, a species described form southwestern China and also similar to A. griseopantherina in appearance, has a relatively smaller basidioma, and is found in forests dominated by Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower altitudes (Yang  1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina, a species descri- bed from Europe but not found in China, has a relatively lower annulus, narrower basidiospores and no clamps (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita pseudopantherina, a provisional name proposed by Yang (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015) and formally described as a novel species in this study, differs from A. griseopantherina by its relatively pale (brown to yellow-brown) pileus and the absence of clamps. Amanita velatipes, described from North America, can be easily distinguished from A. griseopantherina by its paler pileus covered with white patches, and smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b;\n",

Amanita atrofusca Zhu L. Yang was treated as a novel synonym of A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille. The microscopic structure of the volva, including the arrange- ment and proportion of inflated cells and filamentous hyphae, seems to be one of the most important traits for the characterization of the species in this section.

            "Commentary:  Amanita  zangii  was  placed   in   A.  sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) exclusively based on morphological study, due to the felted to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal mar- gins, narrowly clavate to subfusiform stipe bases, and the volval remnants on the pileus with long ellipsoid to sub- fusiform  inflated  cells  (Yang  et  al.   2001;   Yang   2005, 2015). It was suggested that this species is very similar to A. hesleri and A. inopinata D. A. Reid & Bas (Yang et al. 2001). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it is indeed sister to A. hesleri Bas, but that it should  be moved to A. sect. Phalloideae  (Cai  et al. 2014; this study).\n",
            "Amanita areolata T. Oda et al., described from Japan, was suspected to be a synonym of A. zangii (Yang 2005). Phylogenetically, the type of A. areolata fell within the clade of A. zangii with high support (Cai et al. 2014), and the morphological characters of A. areolata are identical to those in A. zangii. Therefore, we treat A. areolata as a synonym of A. zangii. For detailed descriptions, compar- isons with similar species and images of A. zangii see Yang et al. (2001) and Yang (2005, 2015).\n",

Roanokenses of Amanita subgen. Amanitina. Amanita sect. Roanokenses was proposed by Singer in 1951 but was invalid due to the absence of the Latin diagnosis (Bas 1969; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Singer (1962a) then effec- tively proposed the name of A. sect. Roanokenses Singer, typified by A. roanokensis Coker, and provided a brief Latin diagnosis, 鈥樷楶ileo stipiteque pulvere detersili obtec- tis鈥欌. In this study, 35 species of A. sect.

Chiu can be distinguished from A. manginiana by its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., an apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, a thin, white, limbate volva on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a; this study). Thus, we describe A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu here as a novel species.

Fortunately, we have col- lected a specimen (HKAS 101268) similar to A. mangini- ana from Vietnam, which has been included in our study. Our current multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) indicates that the Vietnamese specimen (HKAS 101268) clusters within the monophyletic Chinese clade with 100% statistical support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of specimens are consistent with the protologue and type illustration of A. manginiana, except for the absence of the yellowish pileal margin (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a).

Furthermore, HKAS 71041, which was collected in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan near the type locality and matches well with the characters of A. spissacea, clustered within the A. spissacea clade (Fig. S14).

Because Gilbert (1925) had it as a generic name, and one that proved to be illegitimate because it was a later homonym, it cannot serve as a basionym (Art. 49.1, McNeill et al. 2012). It must therefore be regarded as a replacement name (Art. 7.4) and is to be typified by the type of the replaced name. The type of 鈥樷楲epidella Gilbert鈥欌 by original designation was Agaricus vittadinii. Recently, an epitype was selected for the type species of A. subgen. Lepidella and sect. Lepidella, namely A. vittadinii (Vizzini et al. 2016b).\n",

            "and Redhead et al. (2016). In our study, we treat this clade as a section under Amanita, A. sect. Lepidella, for the following three reasons: 1) in our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1a, b), this clade was only moderately supported as a monophyletic group (MLB = 77%), but it was closely rela- ted to the remaining clades of Amanita as monophyletic with strong support (MLB = 97%), and was also supported in the ITS phylogenetic analysis of Vizzini et al. (2012) with MLB = 100% and BPP = 1; 2) morphologically, the agari- coid and sequestrate taxa in Amanita s.l. (the monophyly contained this clade, A. subgen. Amanita and A. subgen. Amanitina) have a schizohymenial ontogeny in their devel- opment (Reijnders 1963; Bas 1969; Yang and Oberwinkler 1999; Tulloss et al. 2016); 3) to maintain the nomenclatural stability of Amanita, we prefer to treat this clade as part of the genus Amanita and use the oldest available subgeneric and sectional names for it, although the context of the subgenus and section has been changed dramatically in comparison with that of Bas (1969), which seems, unfortunate, but unavoidable. The remaining species should be assigned to Amanita subgenus Amanitina, including its sect. Strobili- formes, sect. Phalloideae and sect. Roanokenses.\n",

Furthermore, it is found in subalpine forests dominated by Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. flavopantherina is, with low support, related to A. mus- caria, A. regalis, A. persicina, A. ibotengutake, A. gemmata and A. concentrica. However, these species differ mor- phologically from A. flavopantherina in the following ways. Amanita muscaria, a species described from Europe and also found in northern, northeastern and northwestern China, has a red pileus and relatively narrower basid- iospores     measuring     9.0鈥12.5  9 7.0鈥8.5  lm  (Gilbert\\n1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000;\\nGalli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). The European A. regalis has a brown pileus covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita persicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus, cream lamellae with a pinkish  tint  and  relatively  narrower  basidiospores\\n \\n(9.4鈥12.7 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986;  Tulloss et al. 2015). Amanita ibotengutake has white to grayish volval remnants on the pileus, smaller basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.23鈥1.38, Qm = 1.32 卤\\n0.06), and is found in temperate forests (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015). Specimens of A. gemmata listed under A. concentrica differ from A. concentrica by their grayish yellow to yellowish pilei, volval remnants on the pileus composed primarily of subradically arranged elements with very abundant to nearly dominant filamentous hyphae, narrower basidiospores (9.5鈥12.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm), and absence of clamps. The comparisons between A. concen- trica and A. flavopantherina are given in commentary on A. concentrica.\\nAmanita flavopantherina is easily confused with A. griseopantherina Yang-Yang Cui et al. as they have similar appearance and habitats, and for comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. griseopantherina.\\nA species similar to A. flavopantherina and sharing a basidioma with clamps, also found in Abies forest is A. pakistanica Tulloss et al., but the latter differs by its umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, white, detersile volval remnants, and relatively narrower basid- iospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7.0鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). Our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) suggests that they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita subglobosa Zhu L. Yang and A. pantherina (DC.) Krombh. are also similar to A. flavopantherina in their brown basidiomata. However, A. subglobosa has white volval remnants on the pileus and is dominant in forests of Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower alti- tudes (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina has narrower   basidiospores   and   no   clamps    (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000;\\nWasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Molecular phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S6) indicate that they are distinct species.\\n',\n",

Amanita regalis has yellow volval remnants on the pileus and relatively broader basidiospores (9鈥11 9 7鈥8 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita per- sicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus covered with yellowish to tannish, floccose-fibrillose patches, cream lamellae with pinkish tint, a stipe whose context turns yellowish when cut or bruised and relatively larger basidiospores (9.4鈥12.7 9 7鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\nFor differences between A. ibotengutake and A. flavopantherina see the commentary on A. flavopantherina.

This species is described from Europe and represents the type species of the genus Amanita (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Jenkins and Petersen 1976; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang\\n2005, 2015). Yang and Oberwinkler (1999) provided a detailed study on the basidiomal development and anatomy of A. muscaria.\\nAmanita muscaria was traditionally treated as a single morphospecies with several varieties (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Wasser 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Geml et al. 2006, 2008) and has been reported as a common, widespread, easily identifiable, ecologically plastic fungus with a wide niche (Coker 1917; Jenkins 1977, 1986; Reid 1980; Thiers 1982; Garrido 1986;\\n \\n\\n \\nReid and Eicker 1991; Ridley 1991; Tulloss et al. 1995; Bhatt et al. 2003; Oda et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; Vargas et al. 2017). However, the studies of Geml et al. (2006) and Geml et al. (2008) indicated that the mor- phospecies A. muscaria represents more than one phylo- genetic species.\\nIn    the    multi-locus    analysis    (ITS ? b-tubu-    lin ? LSU ? ef1-a) of Geml et al. (2008), the morphos- pecies A. muscaria was divided into eight clades with strong inter- and intracontinental phylogeographic struc- ture. In our ITS analysis (Fig. S6), our Chinese specimens, HMJAU 4548, HMJAU 4549, and HKAS 61888, clustered\\nwithin the clade II of Geml et al. (2008), which contained many specimens from Eurasia and Alaska.\\nIn our multi-locus analysis (Fig. 1b), A. muscaria was found to be closely related to A. persicina. However, A. persicina has a relatively paler colored (pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored) pileus covered with pale yellow to yellowish-tan to tan, floccose-fibrillose patches and cream lamellae with a pinkish tint (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\n',\n",

How- ever, A. elata has a relatively paler pileus (yellowish- brown) covered with floccose to pulverulent volval rem- nants, no annulus and relatively larger basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 7鈥9 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015).\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. gleocys- tidiosa clustered within the monophyletic clade of A. sychnopyramis and because of this, coupled with the presence of the annulus mentioned in Li et al. (2016), led us to treat it as a synonym of A. sychnopyramis f. suban- nulata. The presence  of cystidia in A. gleocystidiosa (Li  et al. 2016) could be a misinterpretation.\\n \\n\\n \\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata see Yang (1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita sect.

M. Young & A. E. Wood, A. umbrinella E.-J. Gilbert & Cleland and A. merxmuelleri Bresinsky & Garrido) as a distinct clade with high support\\n \\n(Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017; this study). Fur- thermore, species in this clade can be characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidioma, thick-walled and ornamented, or thin-walled and smooth basidiospores, the presence of clamps and distributions through the Southern Hemisphere in forests with Nothofagus and Eucalyptus. Therefore, we treated this clade as a novel section. Bougher and Lebel (2002) proposed the genus Amarrendia typified by Amarrendia oleosa. Then Justo et al. (2010) treated Amarrendia as a synonym of Amanita located in 鈥樷楢mar- rendia clade鈥欌 without section assignment by molecular data. In our study, we named this section  as  Amanita  sect. Amarrendiae based on the basionym of Amarrendia. Based  on  our  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. 1a,  b),  A. sect. Amarrendiae was sister to A. sect. Amanita.\\nAlthough no species from A. sect. Amarrendiae were found in China, we have studied collections of A. pseu- doinculta and A. umbrinella from Australia and provided morphological descriptions below, together with DNA sequences submitted to NCBI.\\nAmanita pseudoinculta Justo, Mycologia 102(3): 682\\n(2010).\\nFigure 7.\\nBasidioma\\tsequestrate,\\tstipitate.\\tGleba\\tloculate.\\nBasidiospores   (Fig. 7)   [30/2/2]   (11.0鈥)   13.0鈥16.0 9\\n7.5鈥9.5 lm,  Q = (1.47鈥)   1.53鈥1.82,   Qm = 1.67 卤 0.1,\\nellipsoid to elongate, statismosporic, inamyloid, mostly thin to slightly thick-walled (less than 0.5 lm thick).

In our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. pseudoinculta  is  closely  related  to  A.  inculta  in  A. sect. Amarrendiae. However, A. inculta differs from A. pseudoinculta in that its gleba often fragments as the stipe\\n \\n\\nFig. 7 Basidiospores of Amanita pseudoinculta (PERTH 08105731).

How- ever, A. torrendii, a species in A. sect. Caesareae, differs from A. pseudoinculta by its narrower basidiospores (12.6鈥16.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm, Q = 2.37) and distribution in southern Europe and northern Africa in association with Pinus,  Larix  and  Quercus  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and Horak 1992; Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandis has a relatively larger pileus (up to 4 cm in diam.) expanding outwards from stipe exposing much of the lower gleba, and a cylindrical stipe with its apex extending through the entire gleba to the top of the pileus (Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita oleosa has an astipitate basidioma, locules in the gleba filled with liquid, and rel- atively broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basid- iospores (12.5鈥15.0 9 9.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = 1.39) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandispora has an astipitate basidioma and broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basidiospores (13.0鈥17.0 9 9.5鈥11.5 lm, Q = 1.43) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita nouhrae has distinctly ornamented, subglobose to deformed basidiospores  (14.0鈥20.0 9 12.5鈥17.5 lm, Q = 1.05鈥1.25), is distributed in northern Patagonia and is associated with Nothofagus antarctica (Truong et al. 2017).\\nAmanita umbrinella E.-J.

In the study of Truong et al. (2017) and in our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), four agaricoid species in A. sect. Amar- rendiae, including A. morenoi, A. muriniflammea, A. umbrinella and A. merxmuelleri, clustered as separated lineages and represented different species. However, their morphological characters are still insufficiently known due to limited material.\\nAmanita sect. Caesareae Singer ex Singer, Acta Inst. Bot. Acad. Sci. USSR, Ser. II, Plant.

For the unique sequestrate and stipitate spe- cies, A. torrendii, basidiospores inamyloid and clamps present. Commentary: This study reports 20 species of Amanita sect. Caesareae from China, including six novel species and 14 known species. Of the known taxa, A. hemibapha var. ochracea was elevated to species rank as A. ochracea. To date, no sequestrate taxa of this section have been reported from China. Previous studies and our multi-locus phylogenetic data indicate that the genus Torrendia is a synonym of A. sect.

We also studied a collection of A. caesareoides from Russia, VLAM-3904.

Unfortu- nately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from it. Amanita caesareoides is phylogenetically closely rela- ted and morphologically similar to the European A. cae- sarea (Fig. 1b). Examination of European specimens of A. caesarea has revealed that Amanita caesarea can be dis- tinguished from A. caesareoides by its non-umbonate pileus with relatively shorter striations on its margin, a short, robust stipe and larger basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

In our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), A. esculenta was found to be related to A. hunanensis Y. B. Peng & L. J. Liu, A. yua- niana Zhu L. Yang and A. spreta (Peck) Sacc. However, these species can be distinguished from A. esculenta through   the   following   characters.   A.   hunanensis  and\\nA. yuaniana both have a pileus with distinct innate spots or speckles  (Peng  and  Liu  1981;  Yang  1994,   1997,  2005, 2015; Yang and Zhang 2002). Amanita spreta, described from the USA, differs from A. esculenta by its relatively paler colored pileus (whitish or pale brown) and narrower,   elongate   to   cylindric   basidiospores  (Murrill\\n \\n1913; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S7), collections of TRTC-150314 (ITS = JX844717) and DMSC09996 (ITS = KT213721), which\\nwere identified as A. hemibapha s. l. by Sa麓nchez-Ram麓谋rez et al. (2015) and Amanita sp. 2 by Parnmen et al. (2016) separately, clustered within A. rubromarginata with strong support. Thus, we consider that these two collections should be assigned to A. rubromarginata.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. rubromarginata is somewhat related to A. javanica. We have checked a specimen of A. javanica from Malaysia. Amanita javanica can be distinguished from A. rubro- marginata by its orange-yellow to ocher yellow pileus with a relatively paler reddish tinge, an orange annulus with a less reddish tinge, and its distribution in tropical forests domi- nated by Dipterocarpaceae (Corner and Bas 1962; Tang et al. 2018; this study).

Bas, clusters with the Chinese ones as a monophyletic clade with good support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of collections from this clade match well with the protologue, especially the subglobose basidiospores. Thus, we treat this clade as A. longistriata.\\nAmanita longistriata is phylogenetically related and morphologically similar to A. incarnatifolia, A. ristichii, A. virginiana and A. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b). However, these species can be distinguished from A. longistriata in the following ways. Amanita incarnatifolia has relatively shorter striations on the pileus margin, relatively narrower basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 7.0鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.31鈥1.5,  Qm = 1.4 卤 0.07) and is dominant in  pine, broad-leaved or mixed forests with Pinaceae and Fagaceae (Imazeki and Toki 1955; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana has a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus and white to off-white lamellae (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993). Amanita cf. incarnatifolia has relatively narrower basidiospores (10.0鈥13.5 9 8.0鈥10.0 lm, Q = 1.25鈥1.5, Qm = 1.36 卤 0.08) and is dominant in broad-leaved or mixed forests, but more collections are needed to allow a formal description of A. cf. incarnatifolia.\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. longistriata are given in Yang (2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

KUALA  LUMPUR: Kepong,\\naltitude  unknown,  6  October  1999,  Farid  2830  (FRIM\\n2830).\\nCommentary: Amanita princeps was described from Singapore by Corner and Bas (1962), and subsequently reported from China, India, Malaysia and Thailand (Yang 2005, 2015; Sanmee et al. 2008; Bhatt et al. 2017; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Little information was known of this species from or near its type locality until Tang et al. (2018). Tang et al. (2018) identified A. princeps with both morphological and molecular evidence based on materials from Malaysia (FRIM 62849 and FRIM 2811), which were collected near its type locality and which were morpho- logically consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the Chi- nese specimens clustered with A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849) as two subclades based on PTP analysis. We have examined a specimen of A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849), and the basidiospores were [20/1/1] 8.5鈥10.5 (鈥11.5) 9 7.0鈥10.0 (鈥11.5) lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.18\\n(鈥1.29), Qm = 1.09 卤 0.06. There are subtle morphologi- cal differences between specimens in the two subclades from China and Malaysia, but they share a large basidioma, a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer layer often cracking and peeling into thin patches, and globose, sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores, all of which are consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962). Consequently, we currently con- servatively treated the specimens in these two subclades as\\nA. princeps and submitted their DNA sequences to NCBI under that name. In addition, our phylogenetic data indicate that HKAS 60269, treated as Amanita sp. 8 in Yang (2015), should be A. princeps (Figs. 1b, 2).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. princeps was closely related to the Australian A. egregia D.\\nA. Reid. However, A. egregia has a white basidioma and has an Australian distribution in association with eucalypt trees (Reid 1978, 1980).\\nAmanita princeps can be easily confused with A. pseu- doprinceps Yang-Yang Cui et al. because of the yellow- brown pileus with short striations (0.25鈥0.3 R). However,\\nA. pseudoprinceps, a novel species described in this study, differs from A. princeps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 7鈥12 cm diam., and a white saccate volva with its outer surface not cracking into brownish patches.\\n \\nAmanita princeps is similar to A. aporema, but the latter has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., a more red-brown pileus with longer striations ca.\\n0.5 R, and a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer surface white and not cracking into patches (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. princeps are given in Yang (2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

The latter was identified based on the collection RET-356-10 (ITS = MF928093)   by   Sa麓nchez-Ram麓谋rez   et   al.   (2015). Whether RET-356-10 represents A. rubroflava or a new taxon needs further morphological studies with more collections.\\nIn China, A. rubroflava can be confused with A. hemi- bapha (Zhang et al. 2004; Yang 2005). Our ITS phyloge- netic analysis (Fig. S7) showed that the collection HKAS 38416 (ITS = AY436460), identified as A. hemibapha in Zhang et al. (2004) and Yang (2005), clustered within the\\nA. rubroflava clade with strong support. Consequently, HKAS 38416 should be determined as A. rubroflava. In addition, A. hemibapha differs morphologically from A. rubroflava by its non-umbonate pileus, narrower basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥6.5) and its tropical distribution (Gilbert 1941a; Pegler 1986; Vrinda et al. 2005; Sanmee  et al. 2008; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubroflava is similar to A. caesareoides in that they share umbonate pilei and the basidiospores are of similar size, however, the latter has a more red to orange- red pileus and is dominant in temperate East Asia (Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988; Cho et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Endo et al. 2016).\\nAmanita caesarea and A. masasiensis Ha篓rk. & Saarim. are also comparable to A. rubroflava in their macroscopic appearance. However, the European A. caesarea has a robuster basidioma with an obviously shorter stipe, an orange pileus lacking an umbo and longer basidiospores (8.5鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu\\n2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita masasiensis, described from Tanzania, has a relatively smaller basid- ioma, a non-umbonate pileus, ellipsoid to elongate basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 6.0鈥7.0 lm), and is dominant in woodland often with trees of the genera Brachystegia, Combretum, Julbernardia, Syzygium and Uapaca (Ha篓rko篓- nen et al. 1994; Tang et al. 2015).\\n',\n",

Oda, C. Tanaka & Tsuda (Fig. 1b). However, A. imazekii, a species described from Japan and also found in China, has a relatively larger basidioma, and a white stipe densely covered with white to grayish squamules (Oda et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).\\nMorphologically, A. squarrosipes is similar to A. mur- rilliana Singer, A. esculenta Hongo & I. Matsuda, A. princeps Corner & Bas and A. longistriata S. Imai. How- ever, A. murrilliana has a white stipe and relatively broader basidiospores (7.8鈥8.6 9 11.7鈥13.3 lm) (Murrill 1941; Singer 1951; Jenkins 1979). Amanita esculenta has\\n \\nrelatively shorter striations (0.1 R) on the pileal margin and relatively longer basidiospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 7.5鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.24鈥1.45, Qm = 1.35 卤 0.09) (Matsuda and Hongo 1955; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011).

Commentary: Amanita yuaniana was described from China by Yang (1994). Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. yuaniana is related to A. hunanensis. However, A. hunanensis differs from A. yuaniana in the relatively longer striations on its margin (ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R) and fairly abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base (Peng and Liu 1981; Yang and Zhang 2002;\\nYang 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita esculenta and A. spreta are also morphologi- cally similar to A. yuaniana. However, A. esculenta can be distinguished from A. yuaniana by its pileus lacking innate speckles (Matsuda and Hongo 1955; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita spreta, described form the USA, has a pileus lacking innate speckles and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.2鈥13.3 9 5.5鈥7 lm) (Murrill 1913; Coker 1917;\\nJenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).

Vaginatae is often difficult (Bas 1977). In this study, we documented 32 Chinese taxa from this section based on multi-locus phylogenetic, mor- phological and partial ecological evidence, including 13 novel species and 19 known taxa (17 species and two varieties). Amanita atrofusca Zhu L. Yang was treated as a novel synonym of A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille. The microscopic structure of the volva, including the arrange- ment and proportion of inflated cells and filamentous hyphae, seems to be one of the most important traits for the characterization of the species in this section. In addition, DNA sequences are very useful for delimitation of the species.\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

This species is characterized by its gray-brown pileus without an umbo, longer striations up to 0.5 R on the pileal margin, sparse lamellae, a small, white saccate volva on stipe base, globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.5鈥11.0 9 9.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.05,  Qm = 1.03 卤 0.13), and the absence of clamps.\\nThe diagnosis mentioned in the protologue of this taxon (as Amanitopsis vaginata var. angustilamellata) was very brief, and since then few reliable descriptions have been made (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Pegler 1986;\\nYang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017). Consequently, the delimita- tion of A. angustilamellata remains poorly understand.\\nCorner and Bas (1962) mentioned that the narrow gills of this species may be an unreliable character. Pegler (1986) reported the presence of clamps in the pileipellis based on Sri Lankan materials, but this differed from the reports of Corner and Bas (1962) and Yang (2005). Boedijn (1951) and Lee (2017) did not mention the presence or absence of clamps of this species. Based on the protologue and reexamination of the type (FH 4712), HKAS 24158 was identified as A. angustilamellata by Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). In this study, we follow the treatments of\\nA. angustilamellata in Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of the Chinese A. angustilamel- lata see Yang (2005).\\nYang (2015) reported the presence of A. angustilamel- lata in China based on HKAS 83453. However, our multi- locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicated that HKAS 83453 grouped together with HKAS 89451 as a distinct clade, and collections in this clade had a more northern subtropical to temperate distribution compared with A. angustilamellata. Thus, HKAS 83453 and HKAS 89451 may represent a novel species, but its classification cannot be clarified until further collections are made to better estimate morphological characters and geographic distributions.\\n',\n",

In our multi-locus phyloge- netic data (Fig. 2), specimens of A. aff. brunneofuliginea from Europe and A. brunneofuliginea specimens from Asia split into two sister clades. These were identified as two phylogenetic species based on GCPSR analysis, but com- bined as a single phylogenetic species based on PTP analysis.\\nCollections of A. aff. brunneofuliginea have an umbonate, gray to grayish pileus ca. 5 cm in diam., stria- tions ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R on the pileal margin, cream to whitish lamellae, a white to grayish stipe ca. 11鈥15 cm long 9 0.5鈥1 cm diam., a saccate, easily broken volva with its outer surface dirty white with yellowish to ocheraceous spots and its inner surface dirty white, globose to subglobose basidiospores measuring [60/3/3] 11.0鈥13.0 9\\n10.0鈥12.0 (鈥12.5) lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.1, Qm = 1.05 卤 0.03, an\\nabsence of clamps and an association with trees of the genera Abies, Picea and Fagus. Amanita aff. brunneo- fuliginea can be distinguished from A. brunneofuliginea by its relatively smaller basidioma, a paler colored (grayish to gray) pileus, and globose to subglobose basidiospores. In this study, we therefore treat these taxa as two separate species: A. aff. brunneofuliginea and A. brunneofuliginea. Further study and more collections are necessary before\\nA.\\taff. brunneofuliginea can be formally described.

However, A. constricta has a relatively larger and robuster basidioma with a gray to brownish gray pileus ca. 5鈥13 cm in diam., lamellae at first white and then becoming gray, and gray lamellar edges. Moreover, A. constricta occurs during the winter months in the USA (Thiers and Ammirati 1982; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss 1994). Amanita cinnamomea has cinnamon lamellar edges and distributed in tropical forests with trees of Fagaceae (Thongbai et al. 2018).\\nAmanita tenuifulva, a novel species described in this study, is easily confused with A. changtuia. However, A. tenuifulva has a non-umbonate pileus and is found in the southern regions of China. The European A. fulva is similar to A. changtuia in the color of its pileus and the similar\\n \\nbasidiospores. However, A. fulva has a relatively shorter stipe, and a brownish, saccate volva with inflated cells dominant in the outer part (Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000; Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita orientifulva also somewhat resembles A. changtuia in appearance. However, A. orientifulva has a robuster and larger basidioma, a brownish volva with abundant inflated cells in its inner part, and relatively larger basidiospores (10鈥14 9 9.5鈥13 lm) (Yang et al. 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

In China, specimens of A. griseofolia have been identified as A. ceciliae (Berk. & Broome) Bas (Yang 1997). Indeed, A. griseofolia is closely related to A. ceciliae (Fig. 1b). However, the European A. ceciliae dif- fers from A. griseofolia by its brown pileus with a yellow tinge, white lamellae that do not change to gray when dried and more filamentous hyphae in the volval remnants on the pileus  (Phillips  1990;  Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995; Massart 2000; Yang 2004, 2005, 2015; this study).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cates that A. griseofolia is also somewhat related to A. submembranacea (Bon) Gro篓ger, but the latter has a brown, brownish to buff pileus with an olivaceous tinge, volval remnants on the pileus are absent or retained as patches mostly concentrated over the disc, a saccate volva on the stipe base and distributions in forest dominated by Abies and Picea (Tulloss 1994; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; this study).\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. griseofolia see Yang (2004, 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

Singer.\\n \\nIndeed, they are similar morphologically in that they share a yellow pileus. However, the European A. crocea differs from A. orienticrocea by its obviously saffron orange pileus, white lamellae lacking a gray tinge and a stipe decorated with distinctly orange  squamules  (Gilbert  1940, 1941a; Tulloss 1997, 2000a; Contu 2000a; Massart 2000; Galli 2001).\\nIn China, A. orienticrocea is morphologically similar to\\nA. orientifulva Zhu L. Yang, M. Wei脽 & Oberw. and A. albidostipes Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang. However, A. orientifulva has a dark brown to red-brown pileus, brown to brownish lamellar edges, a dirty white stipe covered with red-brown to gray-brown squamules, brown patches on the outer surface of the volva, relatively larger basidiospores (10鈥14 9 9.5鈥13 lm), and is found in subalpine forests (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita albidostipes has a non-umbonate pileus, white lamellae without gray tinge when young, and the outer surface of the volva often has a brown tinge.\\nIn addition, A. subnudipes (Romagn.) Tulloss and A. romagnesiana Tulloss are also similar to A. orienticrocea. However, A. subnudipes has an orange pileus and relatively narrower   basidiospores    (8.9鈥12.2 9 7.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.12鈥1.16) (Tulloss 2000a, b).

Yang (1997) examined the holotype, and found that the basidiospores were [40/2/1] (8.0鈥)  8.5鈥10.0  (鈥10.5) 9 (6.0鈥)  6.5鈥7.5  (鈥8.0)  lm,\\nQ = (1.19鈥)  1.25鈥1.42  (鈥1.47),  Qm = 1.32 卤 0.06.  To\\ndate, no sequences of A. ovalispora from its type locality are available to delimitate this species accurately. Conse- quently, we conservatively treat the Chinese collections, which match well with the characters of the protologue and the holotype of A. ovalispora, as this species for the time being.\\nAmanita ovalispora harbors a species complex. In our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), specimens labeled as A. ovalispora split into three subclades, which were separated into three phylogenetic species based on PTP analysis. In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S8), A. subovalispora, a species described from Thailand (Thongbai et al. 2018), also clustered within the A. oval- ispora complex. Further studies are needed to classify the\\nA. ovalispora complex accurately. For detailed descrip- tions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. ovalispora see Yang (1997, 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

However, A. pallidocarnea can be easily distinguished from A. palli- dozonata by its red to pinkish lamellae, a pinkish stipe covered with minute, concolorous squamules and associa- tions with broad-leaved  trees  (Boedijn  1951;  Yang  2001, 2005, 2015).\\nThe pale, ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations and globose to subglobose basid- iospores of A. pallidozonata are reminiscent of A. umbri- nolutea, but the latter has a darker colored basidioma, and scarce inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base\\n \\n\\n \\n(Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita zonata, a novel species described in this study, also has a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the mar- ginal striations and could be confused with A. pallido- zonata. However, A. zonata has relatively smaller basidiospores (9.0鈥10.5 9 8.5鈥10.0 lm) and it is found in tropical forests with Fagaceae.\\nThe Chinese A. brunneofuliginea resembles A. pallido- zonata in that they share a brown-colored pileus. However,\\nA. brunneofuliginea has a relatively larger basidioma, a brown pileus lacking a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and abundant inflated cells in the outer  part  of  the  volva  on  the  stipe  base   (Yang   1997, 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

Because there are abundant inflated cells in the outer part of the volva, the volva can easily be broken during the development of the basidioma. Specimens of A. retenta with entirely white basidiomata have also been collected in the field.\\nOur phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not uncover any species closely related to A. retenta. Amanita retenta is morphologically similar to A. nivalis, described from Europe. However, A. nivalis has a relatively shorter basidioma with its stipe ca. 4鈥8 cm long, and was descri- bed as a snow-bed agaric in association with Carex, Gal- ium and Polytrichum (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Watling 1985; Campo and Bizio 2000; Contu 2000b; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are also similar to A. retenta in macroscopic appearance. However, they can be separated from A. retenta in their broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm for A. ovalispora; 10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm for\\nA. pseudovaginata), and the inflated cells are concentrated\\n \\nin the inner part of the volva (Boedijn 1951; Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nThe white basidioma of A. retenta could be misidenti- fied as the European A. vaginata var. alba Gillet. For example, HKAS 82591 was erroneously treated as A. vaginata var. alba by Yang (2015) and should be a species of A. retenta based on our ITS  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. S8). However, A. vaginata var. alba differs from the white basidioma of A. retenta by the absence of volval remnants on the pileus, and the irregularly distributed, brownish spots on the outer surface of the volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Galli 2001).\\n',\n",

Indeed, A. tenuifulva is similar to A. fulva in their similarly colored basidioma. We have examined collections of A. fulva from Europe: the basidiospores\\twere\\t[145/6/4]\\t(9.5鈥)\\t10.0鈥14.0\\t(鈥\\n17.0) 9 (9.0鈥) 9.5鈥13.5 (鈥15.5) lm, Q = 1.00鈥1.12  (鈥\\n1.17), Qm = 1.06 卤 0.03, globose to subglobose, inamy- loid; volval remnants on the stipe base were composed longitudinally of two parts: inflated cells were dominant in the outer part, but became scarce towards the inner part. Based on the literature and examinations of materials, A. fulva differs from A. tenuifulva in its relatively robust basidioma with a proportionally shorter stipe, and the structure of the volval remnants on the stipe base (Contu 2000a,  b;  Massart  2000;  Yang  et  al.  2004;  Yang  2005, 2015).\\nThe Chinese species, A. orientifulva, also has a brown basidioma. However, A. orientifulva differs from A. tenuifulva in its relatively robuster basidioma, larger basidiospores (10.0鈥14.0 9 9.5鈥13.0 lm) and scarce inflated cells in the outer part of the volval remnants on the stipe base (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

Although there are some subtle morphological differences between the Chinese populations and the European ones (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015), these may be caused by different environmental conditions. Therefore, A. atrofusca is trea- ted here as a synonym of A. umbrinolutea.\\nAmanita umbrinolutea is phylogenetically related to A. pachycolea D. E. Stuntz and Amanita sp. (Figs. 1b, S8). However, Amanita pachycolea differs from A. umbrino- lutea in that its white lamellae are unchanging or becoming tawny to orange-brown or orange-yellow with age, and the presence of clamps (Thiers and Ammirati 1982; Thiers 1982; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss 1994).

[HUBEI PROVINCE: Yichang, Shennongjia, in a subalpine forest with Abies, altitude 1500 m, 10 July 2012, Qing Cai 720 (HKAS 75475)] has a yellow-brown pileus with a yel- lowish to brownish margin and a brownish stipe.\\n',\n",

Amanita zonata can be confused with A. umbrinolutea because of the gray-brown pileus with an indistinct dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and similar basidiospores. However, A. umbrinolutea, a species described from Europe and also found in China, has a darker basidioma, brownish to gray-brown lamellar edges, obvious brown spots on the outer surface of the volva, and relatively larger basid- iospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a;\\nContu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001;\\nNeville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. umbrinolutea is dominant in temperate regions (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora, a species described from Indonesia, is similar to A. zonata in appearance and habitats, but the former can be distinguished from the latter by the grayer to darker gray pileus lacking an obvious dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm) (Boedijn\\n1951; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nIn China, A. brunneofuliginea is somewhat similar to A. zonata in the gray-brown pileus. However, A. brunneo- fuliginea can be easily distinguished from A. zonata by its darker pileus lacking a ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, brown squamules on the outer surface of the volva, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm), and habitat in\\nplantations in subalpine forests (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita subgen.

(2016) proposed Aspidella and Saproamanita respectively to accommodate Amanita vittadinii and its allies (A. sub-  sect. Vittadiniae Bas), and resurrected the subgeneric name Amanitina, typified by A. phalloides, for the remaining species of A. subgen. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969), with the exception of A. subsect. Vittadinii. Our multi-locus phylogenetic anal- ysis indicates that A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic (Fig. 1a, b). To keep the infrageneric taxonomic stability of Amanita (Tulloss et al. 2016), we follow the con- cept of A. subgen. Amanitina as circumscribed by Redhead et al. (2016), but retain the species complex of Amanita vit- tadinii as its own section, A. sect. Lepidella Corner & Bas.\\n\\nKey to the sections of Amanita subgen.\\nAmanitina\\n1.

It is putatively associated with pine trees (e.g. Pinus yunnanensis).\\nAmanita pinophila formed a distinct lineage in our phylogenetic study (Fig. 1b). Amanita pinophila can be easily confused morphologically with A. volvata. However, specimens of A. volvata, which are listed in specimens studied under A. brunneomaculata, have basidiomata with a distinct reddish brown color change when bruised or injured  and   slightly   narrower   basidiospores  (10.0鈥12.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.5鈥1.85, Qm = 1.67 卤\\n0.11) (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).\\nThe East Asian A. avellaneosquamosa and A. clar- isquamosa are also similar to A. pinophila in their white to brownish basidiomata. However, A. avellaneosquamosa has longer striations on the pileal margin, and relatively shorter  basidiospores  (9.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm)  (Imai\\n1933; Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang\\nand Doi 1999). Amanita clarisquamosa has a relatively larger  basidioma   and   longer   basidiospores   (Imai 1933, 1938; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al.\\n2011).\\nAmanita brunneomaculata and A. rufobrunnescens share some characters with A. pinophila. However, they have larger basidiomata. Furthermore, A. brunneomaculata has broader basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 6.5鈥8.0, Qm = 1.65\\n卤 0.19). Amanita rufobrunnescens has a white to brown- ish basidioma with a distinct reddish brown color change when bruised, and occurs in subtropical forests with broad- leaved trees (Deng et al. 2016).\\n',\n",

This species belongs to the lethal Amanita subclade in A. sect. Phalloideae. Cyclope- tide toxins, in particular a-amanitin and b-amanitin, are\\n \\ndetected in all parts of the basidioma and at different stages of development (Deng et al. 2011; Xue  et al. 2011; Hu     et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014b; Chen et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016). It is the leading cause of mushroom poisonings in Guangdong Province, China, where from 2000 to 2014, 22 cases of mushroom poisoning were reported, resulting in 89 affected individuals and 45 deaths (Yang and Li 2001; Deng et al. 2011; Xue et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2012; Cai et al. 2014; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2014, 2016; Li et al. 2014b; Tang et al. 2016).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) shows that A. exitialis is sister to the North American A. subal- liacea (Murrill) Murrill (Cai et al. 2014). Examination of specimens of A. suballiacea from North America indi- cates  that  it  has  4-spored  basidia   and   smaller,  broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.2鈥1.4, Qm = 1.29 卤 0.08) (Murrill\\n1941; Jenkins 1979, 1986; this study). Furthermore, the outer layer of volval remnants on the stipe base in A. suballiacea is composed of wide filamentous hyphae up to 20 lm in diam., while those in A. exitialis are 2鈥7 lm in diam. For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. exitialis see Yang and Li (2001), Yang (2005, 2015) and Cai et al. (2016).\\n',\n",

(2010), and has also been collected from India, Japan, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Far East (Kim et al. 2013a; Malysheva et al. 2014; Bhatt et al. 2017; Kiran et al. 2018; this study). This spe- cies has caused at least five deaths (Zhang et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2011; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2016), and high levels of cyclopetide toxins have been detected in the basidioma of A. pallidorosea (Li et al. 2014a; Tang et al. 2016).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled as A. pallidorosea split into two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Because the differences between indi- viduals in these two subclades were only subtle, we treat them here as a single species, A. pallidorosea. Phyloge- netically, A. pallidorosea was closely related to A. bis- porigera G. F. Atk (Fig. 1b). However, specimens of A. bisporigera from the USA have a non-umbonate pileus, 2-spored basidia and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥9.5 9 7.5鈥9.0 lm) (Lewis 1906; Gilbert 1940, 1941a;\\nJenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. pallidorosea see Zhang et al. (2010), Yang (2015) and Cai et al. (2016).\\n',\n",

Hongo 420] (Holotype, TNS-F-237280).\\nCommentary: Amanita pseudogemmata was described from Japan and treated as a species of A. sect. Amanita due to its striate pileal margin, pulverulent volval remnants on the pileus, a marginate to sublimbate stipe base, and the absence of clamps (Hongo 1974b; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it should be in A. sect. Phalloideae having amyloid basidiospores. Careful reexamination of the col- lections cited above showed that the basidiospores are indeed amyloid, but only weakly.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S11), A. pseudogemmata is sister to A. levistriata. However, the latter differs morphologically in its relatively smaller basidioma with a ca. 1.7鈥3 cm in diam. pileus, volval remnants on the pileus as floccose patches at center, becoming flocculose towards the margin, and its occur- rence in sandy soils in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (Jenkins 1988).

(2015) and is a member of the lethal Amanita subclade of A. sect. Phalloideae. This lethal Amanita species is known to have caused two deaths in Guizhou Province, China in 2014  (Li  et al. 2015;  Chen  et al. 2016). Thirteen cyclopeptides were subsequently identified from the species (Wei et al. 2017).\\nAccording to our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis  (Fig. 1b), collection HKAS 27133, which was identified as\\nA. cf. virosa by Wei脽 et al.

However, A. virosa has a stipe covered with recurved squamules, and larger basidiospores (Contu 2000a; Chiusa 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Zhang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Cai et al. 2016; this study). Furthermore, A. virosa is dominant in temperate Eurasia (Contu 2000a; Chiusa 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Zhang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Cai et al. 2016; this study).

Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) exclusively based on morphological study, due to the felted to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal mar- gins, narrowly clavate to subfusiform stipe bases, and the volval remnants on the pileus with long ellipsoid to sub- fusiform  inflated  cells  (Yang  et  al.   2001;   Yang   2005, 2015). It was suggested that this species is very similar to A. hesleri and A. inopinata D. A. Reid & Bas (Yang et al. 2001). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it is indeed sister to A. hesleri Bas, but that it should  be moved to A. sect. Phalloideae  (Cai  et al. 2014; this study).\\nAmanita areolata T. Oda et al., described from Japan, was suspected to be a synonym of A. zangii (Yang 2005). Phylogenetically, the type of A. areolata fell within the clade of A. zangii with high support (Cai et al. 2014), and the morphological characters of A. areolata are identical to those in A. zangii. Therefore, we treat A. areolata as a synonym of A. zangii. For detailed descriptions, compar- isons with similar species and images of A. zangii see Yang et al.

Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) is polyphyletic and clusters in four clades across two subgenera: sect. Lepidella of Amanita subgen. Lepidella; sect. Strobiliformes,  sect.  Phalloideae  and sect. Roanokenses of Amanita subgen. Amanitina. Amanita sect. Roanokenses was proposed by Singer in 1951 but was invalid due to the absence of the Latin diagnosis (Bas 1969; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Singer (1962a) then effec- tively proposed the name of A. sect. Roanokenses Singer, typified by A. roanokensis Coker, and provided a brief Latin diagnosis, 鈥樷楶ileo stipiteque pulvere detersili obtec- tis鈥欌. In this study, 35 species of A. sect.

For comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. rubiginosa. Most species in A. sect. Roanokenses have white, yellowish to yellow lamellae, while A. avellaneifolia can be easily distin- guished by its biscuit to pale flesh-colored lamellae. Amanita hongoi Bas, described from Japan, is comparable to A. avellaneifolia on account of its similarly colored basidioma. However, A. hongoi has white to yellowish lamellae, a white, dirty white to brownish stipe densely covered with concentrically arranged, minute, concolorous squamules, and clamps are absent in all parts of its basidioma (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2015).\\n',\n",

Chiu (1948) used the name 鈥樷楢. manginiana Har. & Pat.鈥欌 for the collections from Yunnan. However, there are some morphological discrepancies between materials from Yunnan, China and the protologue and type illustration (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Therefore, Yang (1997, 2005, 2015) applied the name A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu to document the Chinese materials.\\nIn our current phylogenetic study (Fig. 1b), A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu and A. manginiana clustered as two distinct monophyletic clades. In addition, A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu can be distinguished from A. manginiana by its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., an apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, a thin, white, limbate volva on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a; this study). Thus, we describe A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu here as a novel species. The name A. caojizong is chosen because it is commonly sold in the mushroom markets of Yunnan Province, China as 鈥樷榗aojizong鈥欌.\\n \\n\\n \\nAccording to our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12), six collections, HKAS 38460 (ITS = AY436463) from Yunnan identified as Amanita manginiana sensu W.\\nF. Chiu by Zhang et al. (2004), FB-30951(CBM) (ITS = AB015702) from Japan identified as A. pseudoporphyria by Oda et al. (2002c), SFC20140823-10 (ITS = KT779083) from the Republic of Korea identified as A. manginiana by Cho et al. (2015), BZ-N11 (ITS = KY747457) from Thailand identified as A. cf. manginiana by Thongbai et al. (2017), and A16 (ITS = FJ441046) and A4 (ITS = FJ441034) submitted to NCBI directly as A. pseudoporphyria, should be A. caojizong.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria Hongo and A. pseudo- manginiana Qing Cai et al. can be confused with A. cao- jizong because of their gray-brown pilei and the limbate volval remnants on the stipe base.

We have examined the holotype of A. grise- ofarinosa from Japan; this specimen includes four half fruiting bodies, which have small basidiomata with pilei ca. 2鈥5 cm in diam., grayish to pallid pilei densely covered with gray to dark gray, tomentose to pulverulent, some- times subconical volval remnants, grayish and farinose stipes ca. 7 cm long 9 0.5 cm diam., no annulus and no clamps. The basidiospores from holotype were [71/3/1] (8.0鈥) 9.0鈥11.0 (鈥12.0) 9 (6.0鈥) 6.5鈥8.5 (鈥10.0) lm,\\nQ = (1.1鈥) 1.18鈥1.47 (鈥1.54), Qm = 1.29 卤 0.09, broadly\\nellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. griseofarinosa is closely related to A. cinereovelata Hosen. However, A. cinereovelata differs from A. griseofarinosa in the presence of clamps and in its associations with Shorea robusta trees (Hosen et al. 2015).\\nAmanita griseofarinosa can be easily confused with A. berkeleyi (Hooker f. in Berk.) due to their shared brownish gray basidiomata covered with pulverulent volval remnants over the entire surface of pilus and stipe, and the absence of clamps, but A. berkeleyi differs from A. griseofarinosa by its distinctly larger basidioma and felted-pulverulent, crust- like volval remnants on the pileus often breaking into minute, polygonal patches (Bas 1969). Yang (2015) reported A. berkeleyi from China based on a morphological\\n \\n\\n \\nstudy of the collection HKAS 83447. However, the col- lection is nested in the clade of A. griseofarinosa in the present study (Fig. 2). Thus, we treated this material as A. griseofarinosa.\\n',\n",

How- ever, A. avellaneifolia has granular to conical, dirty white, grayish white to dark gray volval remnants on the pileus, biscuit-colored lamellae, a white trama without color change when cut, verrucose volval remnants on the stipe base, and shorter basidiospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.07鈥1.35, Qm = 1.2 卤 0.08).

However,\\nA. gymnopus differs from A. luteofolia by its smaller, globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores and a white stipe base lacking volval remnants (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Hongo 1974a; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017).\\nAmanita luteofolia is similar to A. pannosa, a novel species described in this study.

However, A. ochrophylla, described from Australia, has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus 9鈥17 (鈥24) cm, non-removable volval remnants on the pileus and a second ring inside the upper ring on the middle or lower part of stipe (Bas 1969; Reid 1980; Wood 1997).\\n',\n",

Yang 6079 (HKAS 101268).\\nCommentary: The concept of A. manginiana Har. & Pat., a species described by Hariot and Patouillard (1914) from Vietnam, was unclear, because the type is not in good condition for either phylogenetic or morphological study (Gilbert 1941a; Yang 1997). Fortunately, we have col- lected a specimen (HKAS 101268) similar to A. mangini- ana from Vietnam, which has been included in our study. Our current multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) indicates that the Vietnamese specimen (HKAS 101268) clusters within the monophyletic Chinese clade with 100% statistical support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of specimens are consistent with the protologue and type illustration of A. manginiana, except for the absence of the yellowish pileal margin (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Consequently, we treat specimens in this clade as A. manginiana for the present.\\nAmanita manginiana is characterized by its relatively small basidioma with a pileus ca. 5鈥8 cm in diam., a median, thick, persistent annulus, a thick, gray, limbate volva on the stipe base with the inner part composed of abundant to nearly dominant, globose, subglobose, ellip- soid to clavate inflated cells, and ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.7鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.38鈥1.6, Qm = 1.49 卤\\n0.01).\\nAmanita manginiana is similar to A. caojizong, which was treated as A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu in Yang\\n \\n(1997, 2005, 2015) and described as a novel species in this study. However, A. caojizong differs from A. manginiana in its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., the apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, thin, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells.\\nAmanita pseudomanginiana can be confused with A. manginiana in that they share medium-sized basidiomata with gray-brown to brown pilei, median annuli, limbate volval remnants on the stipe base and mostly ellipsoid basidiospores. However, A. pseudomanginiana differs from\\nA. manginiana in its relatively slender basidioma, a thin annulus attached on the middle part of stipe surface, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base with fairly abundant to abundant inflated cells, which are mostly ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria is similar to A. manginiana, but the former has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 cm in diam., an apical, large, fragile annulus, and a thin, white volva on the stipe base with fairly abundant inflated cells (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; see below).\\nAmanita modesta, A. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia are also comparable to A. manginiana in their gray pilei and limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. modesta has a large, apical annulus, a white volva on the stipe  base  and  relatively   smaller   basidiospores  (5.5鈥7.5  9 5.0鈥6.0 lm,     Q  = 1.1鈥1.36,    Qm  =  1.23 卤\\n0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017).

This species has been traditionally put into A. sect. Amidella based on morphological data (Hongo 1982; Tulloss et al. 1992a; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b)  indicates   that   it   actually   belongs   in   A. sect. Roanokenses and is related to A. pseudomanginiana,\\nA. pseudoporphyria and A. atrobrunnea Thongbai et al.\\nIndeed, its inflated stipe base and limbate volva suggest that it is a member of A. sect. Roanokenses. However, the latter three species have a dark brown, gray-brown to gray pileus and white to whitish limbate volval remnants on the stipe base (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016). In addition, A. pseudomanginiana has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 5 cm in diam, while A. atrobrunnea has a broad umbo on the pileal center and a pileipellis composed of radically arranged filamentous hyphae with inflated termi- nal cells (Li et al. 2016).

Indeed, they are also similar in morphological appearance. However, A. heishidingensis has relatively larger verrucae (ca. 1鈥6 mm in height and 1鈥6 mm in width) on the pileus, cream lamellae lacking a greenish tinge and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Li and Cai\\n2014; Yang 2015).\\nThe grayish to gray basidioma, the verrucae on the pileus and the non-radicating basal bulb of A. palli- dochlorotica are also reminiscent of A. japonica and A. griseoverrucosa Zhu L. Yang. However, A. japonica dif- fers from A. pallidochlorotica in that its lamellae lack a greenish tinge and it has a fusiform basal bulb (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014). Amanita griseoverrucosa, a species previously in A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969), but transferred to A. sect. Strobiliformes in this study, differs from A. pallidochlorotica in its white lamellae lacking a greenish tinge, relatively larger basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) and the absence of\\nclamps (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015).\\nThe European species A. solitaria (Bull.: Fr.) Fr. is also comparable to A. pallidochlorotica in the greenish lamel- lae. However, A. solitaria can be easily distinguished by its distinctly larger basidiospores (9.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm)\\n(Gilbert 1940; Bas 1969; Contu 2000a; Yang 2015).\\nOther species in A. sect. Roanokenses that are compa- rable to A. pallidochlorotica, in that they share a gray pileus with volval remnants on its surface often appearing as conical to warted particles, are A. griseofarinosa and A. vestita. However, A. griseofarinosa has white lamellae, a clavate to ventricose basal bulb with the upper part covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants, broader basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) and no clamps (Bas  1969;  Imazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Yang   1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita vestita has a smaller basidioma, white lamellae and no clamps (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

Phylogenetically, A. parvivirginea clustered as a distinct lineage with high divergence from other groups (Fig. 1b). Morphologically, A. parvivirginea is similar to A. vir- gineoides and A. virginea. However, these two species share significantly larger basidiomata and the presence of clamps (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969;\\nYang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Lee 2017).

HAINAN PROVINCE: Ledong County, Jianfengling, in a broad-\\n \\nleaved forest, altitude 800 m, 17 August 1999, Ming-Sheng Yuan 4302 [HKAS 34566, as A. griseoturcosa in Yang (2015)].\\nCommentary: Amanita roseolifolia is characterized by its gray pileus with innate fibrils, the absence of volval remnants on the pileus, white lamellae with a pinkish tinge, a fragile annulus, a limbate flaring volva not appressed to the stipe, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (9鈥11 9 6鈥8 lm), and the absence of clamps.\\nOur phylogenetic data did not detect any species closely related to A. roseolifolia (Fig. 1b). In China, A. roseolifolia was misidentified as A. griseoturcosa by Yang (2015). However, these two species can be separated both by phylogenetic and morphological evidence. Our ITS phy- logenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that the holotype of\\nA. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia fell into two distinct clades. In addition, A. griseotucosa can be morphologically distinguished from A. roseolifolia by its gray pileus with a turquoise tinge, white lamellae and a limbate volva often appressed to stipe (Oda et al. 2002c; Cho et al. 2015).\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria and A. caojizong are similar to A. roseolifolia in appearance. However, the former two species have relatively larger basidiomata with pilei ca. 5鈥15 cm in diam., white lamellae lacking a pinkish tinge and      relatively      smaller      basidiospores      (7.0鈥9.0 9\\n4.5鈥6.0 lm,   Q = 1.27鈥1.7,   Qm = 1.49 卤 0.13   for   A.\\npseudoporphyria; 6.0鈥8.0 9 4.5鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.16鈥1.57, Qm = 1.37 卤 0.09   for   A.   caojizong)   (Hongo   1957;\\n \\n\\n \\nImazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; this study).\\nAmanita modesta is also somewhat similar to A. rose- olifolia in its gray pileus with innate fibrils. However, A. modesta has white lamellae, a fleshy and limbate volva with abundant inflated cells, and globose to broadly ellip- soid basidiospores (5.5鈥7.5 9 5.0鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.36,\\nQm = 1.23 卤 0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015;\\nLee 2017).\\nAmanita pseudomanginiana and A. manginiana are also comparable to A. roseolifolia in that they share gray pilei and limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. pseudomanginiana has white lamellae lacking a pinkish tinge and relatively smaller basidiospores (7.0鈥8.5 9 5.0鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.33鈥1.7, Qm = 1.51 卤 0.1). Amanita\\nmanginiana has white lamellae lacking a pinkish tinge, a thick, gray volva with very abundant inflated cells, and relatively smaller basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.7鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.38鈥1.6, Qm = 1.49 卤 0.01) (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a; this study).\\n',\n",

Yang 5734 [HKAS 80014,\\nidentified as Amanita griseoverrucosa in Yang (2015)].\\nCommentary: Amanita aspericeps is characterized by its medium-sized to large basidioma, a dirty white, grayish to gray pileus covered with gray verrucae that are often white to whitish in their apical part, a subapical annulus, a ven- tricose stipe base with its lower part slightly radicating, broadly ellipsoid, ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (8.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm), the absence of clamps and its occurrence in subtropical forests dominated by Fagaceae, occasionally mixed with Pinaceae.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the spec- imens putatively assigned to a new species split into two subclades (HKAS 77783-HKAS 101391-HKAS 78435\\nsubclade and HKAS 80014-HKAS 100519 subclade) and were recognized as two phylogenetic species based on both GCPSR and PTP analyses. However, no obvious morpho- logical and ecological differences were observed between species in these clades, according to our current study. Consequently, we treat them here as a single species, described here under the name A. aspericeps.\\nAmanita aspericeps is phylogenetically sister and mor- phologically similar to A. cinereoradicata Yang-Yang Cui et al. (Fig. 1b). However, the latter differs from A. aspericeps in its larger basidioma and longer basidiospores (9.5鈥11.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Yuan and Sun 1995; Yang\\n1997, 2005, 2015; see below). Furthermore, A. cinereo- radicata is dominant in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Abies or Picea  (Yuan  and  Sun  1995;  Yang  1997, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nAmanita griseoverrucosa is very similar to A. aspericeps in appearance. However, A. griseoverrucosa has a paler (dirty  white)  pileus  and  an  apical  annulus  (Yang   2004, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nSpecies in A. sect. Roanokenses that share a gray pileus and are comparable to A. aspericeps include A. griseofari- nosa, A. berkeleyi, A. vestita, A. pallidochlorotica and A. cinereoconia G. F. Atk.

It is predominantly associated with broad- leaved trees.\\nOur ITS phylogenetic study (Fig. S14) showed that A. brunneolimbata was closely related to the North American\\nA. brunnescens G. F. Atk. Indeed, these two species are morphologically similar to each other in their reddish often longitudinally splitting basal bulb with a short limbate or collar-like, dirty white to brownish to brown volva. How- ever, A. brunnescens has a relatively robuster basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus often covered with white to pale ocheraceous, floccose patches and is associated with mixed forests (Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita citrina var. grisea (Hongo) Hongo can be confused with A. brunneolimbata because of the similar colors of their basidiomata. However, our phylogenetic data (Fig. S14) indicate that they represent two distinct species, and A. citrina var. grisea differs from A. brun- neolimbata by its non-umbonate pileus, yellow volval remnants on the pileus, and  yellow  annulus  (Hongo  1958, 1959; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; this study). HKAS 79025, treated as A. citrina var. grisea in Yang (2015), is clearly A. brunneolimbata according on our data.\\n',\n",

It is noteworthy that the color of A. citrinoannulata is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, brown, grayish brown to dark brown.\\nPhylogenetically, A. citrinoannulata is closely related and morphologically similar to the European species A. spissa (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Fig. 1b). However, A. spissa differs from A. citrinoannulata in its robust basidioma, a gray pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking snakeskin-like, yellow squamules, white to dirty white volval remnants on the stipe base and a white annulus (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015). Furthermore, the reddish discoloration following bruising of A. spissa only occurs on the stipe surface, while in A. citrinoannulata the discoloration can occur over all\\n \\n\\n \\nparts of the basidioma (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J.\\nE. Lange and A. flavorubens (Berk. & Mont.) Sacc. are morphologically similar to A. citrinoannulata in that they share basidiomata with red discoloration on bruising, and yellow annuli. However, A. rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J. E. Lange has a grayish brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking yel- low, snakeskin-like squamules, and an inflated basal bulb glabrous or covered with dirty white, grayish to brown volval remnants (Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita flavorubens has a brown to yellow pileus covered with patchy, lemon yellow volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores (9.4鈥10.2 9 6.2鈥7.0 lm) (Atkinson 1902; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAdditional species in A. sect. Validae sharing basid- iomata with more or less red discoloration when bruised include A. orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N. Lakh., A. rubescens Pers. and A. excelsa (Fr.: Fr.) Bertillon. However, A. orsonii and A. rubescens have a brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a dirty white to grayish stipe lacking yellow squamules above the annulus, and a white annulus often with a reddish tinge (Gilbert 1940; Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss et al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa, a species described from Sweden, has a robust basidioma with a red tinge only occurring at the stipe base, a white stipe lacking yellow squamules, and a white to dirty white annulus (Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Poumarat 2004).\\nBasidiomata of A. citrinoannulata with a gray-brown to gray pileus are also comparable to those of A. fritillaria Sacc. and A. spissacea S. Imai. However, the basidiomata of the latter two species do not change color when injured (Imai  1933,  1938;  Hongo  1959;  Corner  and  Bas  1962;\\nImazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988,  2011;\\nKumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015). Furthermore, A. fritillaria has a white to dirty white stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, a basal bulb covered with conical, verrucose to floccose, blackish, dark gray to gray- brown volval remnants and a dirty white to gray annulus (Corner and Bas 1962; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang  2005, 2015; this study). Amanita spissacea possesses a dirty white to gray stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, pulverulent to floccose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants on the stipe base, a grayish annulus and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Imazeki and\\nHongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; this study).\\n \\n',\n",

It is predominantly associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S14), HKAS 38419 (ITS = AY436474), which was identified as Amanita sp. 1 in Zhang et al. (2004), clustered within A. flavosquamosa with strong support (MLB = 100%). Therefore, we assign HKAS 38419 to A. flavosquamosa. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. flavosquamosa (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can be confused with A. detersa because of the color and form of the basidiomata, and the volval remnants on the pileus. However, A. detersa pos- sesses a relatively slender basidioma, a thinner but not fragile annulus, pulverulent yellow volval remnants on the stipe base  and  relatively  smaller  basidiospores (7.0鈥8.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is similar to A. flavipes in appearance, but the latter differs by its yellower basidioma and slightly narrower basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥\\n7.0 lm) (Imai 1933; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Tulloss et al. 2001).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is also similar to A. franchetii.

However, A. brunneolocularis differs from A. orsonii morphologically in its gray to black volval remnants on the pileus, the white stipe densely covered with dark gray or blackish fibrils and the annulus with a gray lower surface (Tulloss et al. 1992b). In addi- tion, A. brunneolocularis is found in Central America and Colombia (Tulloss et al. 1992b).\\nAmanita rubescens and A. novinupta Tulloss & J. Lindgr., which share basidiomata with a reddish color change when bruised or injured, are related and similar to\\nA. orsonii. However, A. rubescens has slightly longer basidiospores (7.0鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) and is distributed in more northern regions (Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita novin- upta has a white pileus before discoloration, soft cottony patches on the pileus, relatively longer basidiospores (8.2鈥10.8 9 5.5鈥7.2 lm) and presence of clamps (Tulloss and Lindgren 1994).\\n',\n",

JAPAN. HOKKAIDO: Nopporo, altitude unknown, 10 October 1926, S. Imai (TYPE).\\nCommentary: Imai (1933) described A. sepiacea from Japan without assignment of a type. Hongo (1959) desig- nated a type for the species; it was collected by S. Imai from Nopporo, Hokkaido on 10 October 1926. We exam- ined the type and found that most basidiospores had col- lapsed, and only a few basidiospores could be measured. They were [15/1/1] 7.5鈥9.5 (鈥10.5)  9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥7.2 (鈥7.5)\\nlm,   Q = (1.1鈥)   1.14鈥1.4   (鈥1.45),   Qm = 1.27 卤 0.1,\\nbroadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled A. sepiacea were supported as two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Since morphological differences between them were only subtle, we consider them to be a single species, A. sepiacea. No closely related species of A. sepiacea were detected in our current study (Fig. 1b).

However, our molecular phylogenetic data indicate that these should be two distinct species, lacking a close relationship (Fig. 1b). Amanita spissa is probably widely distributed throughout Eurasia, but in China has only been found in the northeastern (Yang 2015; Fig. 2).\\nPhylogenetically, A. spissa is related to A. citrinoannu- lata (Fig. 1b), and a comparison between these two species is presented in the commentary on A. citrinoannulata. The red-color change on the stipe of A. spissa is comparable to that in A. orsonii and A. rubescens. However, in the latter two species, all parts of the basidiomata color red when\\n \\n\\n \\ninjured, and all have a lighter colored pileus (Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss\\net al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).

The descriptions above were based on the Chinese materials cited here. We also studied four collections from the USA as listed in specimens examined, and the basid- iospores of these specimens were [80/4/4] 6.5鈥8.0 (鈥 10) 9 (5.0鈥) 5.5鈥7.0 (鈥8.0) lm, Q = (1.05鈥) 1.12鈥1.34 (鈥\\n1.4), Qm = 1.22 卤 0.08, often subglobose to broadly ellipsoid, or rarely ellipsoid.\\nOur phylogenetic data (Figs. 1b, S6) indicate that col- lections of A. farinosa from China and the USA form a monophyletic clade within A. sect. Amanita. Since no significant morphological differences were found between the Chinese collections and those from the USA, we treat the Chinese Amanita as A. farinosa.

It is dominant in subalpine forests with Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. griseopantherina is related to A. subglobosa, A. pan- therina, A. pseudopantherina Zhu L. Yang et al. and A. velatipes G. F. Atk. However, A. subglobosa, a species described form southwestern China and also similar to A. griseopantherina in appearance, has a relatively smaller basidioma, and is found in forests dominated by Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower altitudes (Yang  1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina, a species descri- bed from Europe but not found in China, has a relatively lower annulus, narrower basidiospores and no clamps (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita pseudopantherina, a provisional name proposed by Yang (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015) and formally described as a novel species in this study, differs from A. griseopantherina by its relatively pale (brown to yellow-brown) pileus and the absence of clamps. Amanita velatipes, described from North America, can be easily distinguished from A. griseopantherina by its paler pileus covered with white patches, and smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b;\\nJenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita griseopantherina can be easily confused with\\nA.\\tflavopantherina in their similar appearance and habitats. However,  A.  flavopantherina  has  a  darker  brown pileus\\n \\n\\n \\ncovered with yellow volval remnants, a white to yellow context, a relatively lower and yellower annulus with an obviously brown edge, a browner stipe, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (10鈥12 9 8鈥10 lm).\\nAmanita pakistanica is similar to A. griseopantherina in the presence of clamps and Abies hosts. However, A. pakistanica has an umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, detersile volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). In our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita ibotengutake, a species described from Japan and also distributed in northeastern China, is also similar to\\nA. griseopantherina in their brown pileus and the common presence of clamps. However, A. ibotengutake has a rela- tively smaller and slender basidioma, and narrower basid- iospores (8鈥10 9 6鈥7.5 lm) (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015; see below).\\n',\n",

Amanita sychnopyramis f. sychnopyramis and A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata have brownish, gray-brown to dark brown pilei and dirty white to grayish volval remnants on the pileus (Corner and Bas 1962; Hongo 1971; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Lee 2017). Furthermore, A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata has a med- ian annulus (Hongo 1971; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. mira see Yang (1997, 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

It is characterized by its yellowish to yellow pileus covered with white to dirty white, felted, patchy or subpyramidal volval remnants, white to yellow- ish, patchy to verrucose or sometimes appressed-limbate volval remnants on the stipe base, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores and the common presence of clamps.\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis, A. pyriformis clustered within A. orientigemmata as a monophyly with strong statistical support (Fig. S6). We therefore treat A. pyri- formis as a synonym of A. orientigemmata. The presence of cystidia reported in A. pyriformis (Li et al. 2016) should a misinterpretation.\\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. orientigemmata see Yang and Doi (1999), and Yang (2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. pseu- dopantherina was closely related to A. pantherina. How- ever, the European A. pantherina has a robust basidioma, and narrower basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville\\nand Poumarat 2004; this study).\\nIn China, species in Amanita sect. Amanita with brown pileus covered with white, pyramidal, verrucose, conical volval remnants, and shortly limbate volval remnants on the stipe base comparable to A. pseudopantherina include\\nA.\\tparvipantherina, A. subglobosa, and A. subparvipan- therina Zhu L. Yang et al. However, A. parvipantherina has a relatively smaller and slender basidioma, and rela- tively narrower basidiospores (8.5鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm) (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita subglobosa can be distinguished from A. pseudopantherina by its rel- atively darker colored pileus and the common presence of clamps (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita subparvipan- therina possesses narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.0 lm) and more abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the pileus (Ariyawansa et al. 2015; see below).\\nThe North American A. velatipes is somewhat similar to\\nA. pseudopantherina, but the former has a paler yellow pileus covered with warted to patchy volval remnants, and relatively smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b; Jenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\n',\n",

It was subsequently reported from China and Malaysia (Yang 2015; Lee 2017).\\nCollections of A. sychnopyramis f. sychnopyramis and\\nA. sychnopyramis f. subannulata split into two subclades within a monophyletic clade based on PTP analysis of our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2). However, when more collections were included, the two subclades were not supported (Figs. 1b, S6), and collections of A. sychnopy- ramis and its varieties clustered within each other as a single monophyletic clade. In addition, the morphological discrepancy between them is limited to the presence of a median annulus in A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata (Hongo  1971;  Imazeki  and   Hongo   1987;   Yang   2005, 2015). Consequently, we maintain the current taxo- nomic ranks for A. sychnopyramis and its varieties in this study.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. sychnopyramis f. sychnopyramis is related to A. elata. However, A. elata differs morphologically in that it has a relatively paler pileus (yellowish-brown) covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants and relatively lar- ger basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 7鈥9 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015).

(2015). Whether A. aff. princeps (RET 357-5)\\n \\nrepresents A. alboumbelliformis or a new taxon needs more collections and further morphological study.\\nMorphologically, A. alboumbelliformis is similar to A. chepangiana in their white to cream basidiomata. How- ever, A. chepangiana has relatively shorter striations on pileal margin ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R, a fragile, white annulus and subglobose  to  broadly  ellipsoid   basidiospores   (9.5鈥12.5  9 8.5鈥11.5 lm,  Q  = 1.07鈥1.28,   Qm  = 1.17 卤\\n0.06) (Tulloss and Bhandary 1992; Yang 2000; this study). The European A. caesarea f. alba (Gillet) E. J. Gilbert is also comparable to A. alboumbelliformis, but the former has a thicker pileus with shorter striations on its margin, a shorter and thicker stipe, and narrower and longer basid- iospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Galli 2001; Neville\\nand Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita egregia D. A. Reid and A. loosei Beeli are also similar to A. alboumbelliformis. However, A. egregia dif- fers from A. alboumbelliformis by the relatively larger basidioma with pileus that is ca. 10鈥20 cm in diam., and its open eucalypt forest habitat (Reid 1978, 1980). Amanita loosei has relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin, a pure white annulus and relatively longer basidiospores (Gilbert 1940; Walleyn and Verbeken 1998).\\n',\n",

However, the latter can be distinguished by its orange to orange-yellow umbonate pileus, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.25鈥0.35 R) and an orange-yellow annulus.\\nAmanita fuscoflava is also macroscopically similar to A. similis Boedijn, A. malayensis Tang et al. and A. aporema Boedijn. However, A. similis has a yellow stipe covered with pinkish orange squamules and a pinkish orange to grayish annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018).

Our multi-locus phy- logenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. hunanensis is closely related to A. yuaniana. However, A. yuaniana dif- fers from A. hunanensis in its relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (ca. 0.1 R) and scarce inflated cells in the   volval   remnants   on   the   stipe   base   (Yang   1994, 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita esculenta and A. spreta are macroscopically similar to A. hunanensis. However, A. esculenta and A. spreta both have a pileus that lacks innate speckles (Murrill 1913;  Coker  1917;  Matsuda  and  Hongo  1955;  Jenkins\\n1978, 1986; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Tulloss et al. 1995;\\nYang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011).

AOMORI-KEN: Hakkoda-san, altitude unknown, August 1953, S. Toki (TYPE, TF 3355).\\nCommentary: Yang (1997) described A. incarnatifolia to replace the name A. rhodophylla Imazeki & Toki, and the basidiospores from the type of this species are [120/4/1] (10.5鈥) 11.0鈥14.0 (鈥16.5) 9 (7.5鈥) 8.0鈥9.5 (鈥10.5) lm,\\nQ = (1.22鈥) 1.3鈥1.56 (鈥1.69). Yang (2015) then recorded the collection of HKAS 43098 as A. incarnatifolia. In this study, we follow Yang鈥檚 treatment and consider the monophyletic clade, which contains the collection of HKAS 43098, as A. incarnatifolia.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita incarnatifolia is phylogenetically related and morphologically similar to A. longistriata S. Imai, A. ris- tichii Tulloss, A. virginiana (Murrill) Sacc. & Trotter and\\nA. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b). However, A. longistriata has relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, relatively wider        basidiospores         (10.0鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = (1.22鈥) 1.11鈥1.3, Qm = 1.21 卤 0.08) and is dominant in pine forests (Imai 1938; Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Hongo 1959; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus, relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, white to off-white lamellae and relatively wider basid- iospores (12.5鈥13.3 9 9.4鈥11.7 lm, Q = 1.11鈥1.45) (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993). Because morphological dif- ferences between A. longistriata and A. cf. incarnatifolia (specimens examined listed under A. longistriata) are subtle, more collections are necessary before a formal description of A. cf. incarnatifolia is made. In addition, our multi-locus phylogenetic data indicate that HKAS 29519, treated as A. incarnatifolia in Yang (2005), should be transferred to A. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b).\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. incarnatifolia can be found in Yang (2015).\\n',\n",

In  our  phylogenetic  analysis (Fig. 1b), samples of A. hemibapha var. ochracea Zhu L. Yang and A. hemibapha var. hemibapha cluster in distinct clades. Amanita hemibapha var. ochracea differs from A. hemibapha var. hemibapha by its larger and more robust basidioma with a brown umbonate pileus, and its subalpine distribution. Consequently, we treated A. hemibapha var. ochracea as a novel species, A. ochracea.\\nIn our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), three col- lections, RET 317-5 in the multi-locus data, RET 718-7 (ITS = KX810029) and RET 290-5 (ITS = JX 844699) in\\nthe ITS data, which were submitted to NCBI as a provi- sional name of A. cinnamomescens Tulloss et al., clustered together in the monophyletic A ochracea clade. Further- more, the morphological and ecological differences between these three species and A. ochracea are only subtle and they should therefore be considered A. ochra- cea. In addition, one specimen, DAK-M-08 (ITS = KC797155), which was submitted to NCBI under the name\\nA. calyptroderma G. F. Atk. & V. G. Ballen, also clustered within the clade of A.  ochracea  in  our  ITS  analysis  (Fig. S7) and should be A. ochracea.\\nAmanita ochracea is phylogenetically (Figs. 1b, S7) related to A. vernicoccora Bojantchev & R. M. Davis. However, A. vernicoccora, described from the USA, has a relatively smaller basidioma, a yellow pileus covered with a monolithic patch at the center, and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (9.2鈥11.8 9 6.2鈥7.1 lm) (Bojantchev et al.\\n2011).\\nAmanita ochracea is also somewhat similar to A. javanica and A. rubromarginata in its macroscopic appearance. However, the latter two species have a\\n \\nrelatively smaller basidioma, an orange-red to red pileus that is 5鈥13 cm in diameter, yellow lamellae with reddish to orange-red lamellar edges and a reddish to orange-red annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Takahashi 2004; Imazeki et al. 2011; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Amanita ochracea is also comparable to the North Amer- ican A. arkansana H. R. Rosen, but the latter has relatively longer striations on the pileal margin (0.4鈥0.5 R) and smaller basidiospores (7.5鈥10.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Rosen\\n1926; Gilbert 1941a; Jenkins 1986).\\n',\n",

Thus, these three specimens should be A. pseudoprinceps.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cated that A. pseudoprinceps was sister to A. aporema Boedijn. Based on the original description and the exami- nations of collections, A. aporema differs from A. pseu- doprinceps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., and a relatively darker colored pileus (red-brown) with relatively longer striations (ca. 0.5 R) (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita pseudoprinceps can be confused with A. prin- ceps as they share a yellow-brown pileus with short stria- tions (0.2鈥0.3 R). However, A. princeps differs from A. pseudoprinceps in its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 10鈥20 cm in diam., and a white saccate volva with its outer surface cracking and peeling into thin, brownish patches (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018).\\nAmanita pseudoprinceps is similar to the African A. zambiana Pegler & Piearce in appearance, but the latter has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 10鈥20 cm, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.1 R), saccate volval remnants on the stipe base with its outer surface cracking into large, indefinite verrucae, outer sur- face blackish brown, inner surface red-brown (Pegler and Piearce 1980; Pegler and Shah-Smith 1997).\\nAmanita malayensis Tang et al. and A. similis Boedijn are also similar to A. pseudoprinceps.

In this study, we continue to treat these four Chinese specimens as A. similis.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 1b) indicate that\\nA. similis is related to A. subhemibapha and A. fuscoflava.

Amanita fus- coflava has a yellow stipe decorated with yellow squamules and a yellow annulus.\\nMorphologically, A. similis is similar to A. malayensis Tang et al., A. princeps Corner and Bas and A. aporema Boedijn. However, these species differ from A. similis in the following ways. A. malayensis has a yellow pileus with its center yellowish orange, maize yellow or saffron yel- low, relatively shorter striations (0.3鈥0.4 R) on the pileal margin, a yellow stipe decorated with yellow scales, and a yellowish white to whitish annulus (Tang et al. 2018).

However, A. chatamagotake has a yellow or grayish yellow stipe without orange scales, a yellow annulus and relatively shorter striations (0.2鈥0.5 R) on the pileal margin (Endo et al. 2017). Amanita hayalyuy has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 8鈥18 cm, a relatively brighter colored pileus (golden-brown or bright yellow-brown), relatively shorter striations on pileal mar- gin, a yellowish annulus and relatively larger basidiospores (9.3鈥11.7 9 6.2鈥7.8 lm) (Shepard et al. 2008).\\n',\n",

Since few morphological differences were observed between these two phylogenetic species, we treat them as a single species in this study, a conclusion which was also supported by our PTP analysis (Fig. 2). No species closely related to A. battarrae were detected from our current data (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) suggested that HKAS 56255, treated as A. vaginata (Bull.) Lam. var. vaginata by Yang (2015), should be A. battarrae. Amanita battarrae is morphologically similar to A. brunneofuliginea Zhu L. Yang, A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille and A. griseoumbonata Yang-Yang Cui et al. However, A. brunneofuliginea has a relatively larger basidioma with a pileus ca. 5鈥14 cm in diam. and rela- tively broader basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm,\\nQ = 1.06鈥1.24,  Qm = 1.13 卤 0.06)  (Yang  1997,  2005,\\n2015). Amanita umbrinolutea has a relatively darker col- ored pileus and stipe, and brownish to brown lamellar edges (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000;  Massart  2000;  Galli  2001;  Neville  and  Poumarat\\n2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).

Furthermore, it is associated with trees of the family Fagaceae.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cates that A. neocinctipes is related to A. lippiae Wartchow & Tulloss. However, A. lippiae has a pale beige pileus covered with numerous scattered white patches, no annulus or an apparent small subbasal pendant annulus, mostly collar-like volval remnants on the stipe base, ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (10.0鈥21.0 9 7.0鈥11.0 lm), and is\\n \\nfound in sandy soil under Lippia trees (Wartchow et al. 2009).\\nTo date, four species of A. sect.

The former three species can be separated from A. neocinctipes by molecular phylogenetic, morphological and ecological evidence. Amanita cinctipes differs from A. neocinctipes in its globose to subglobose basidiospores (8.7鈥11.5 9 7.9鈥10.1 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; this study). Amanita griseofolia can be distinguished from A. neocinctipes by its globose to subglobose basidiospores (10.0鈥13.5 9 9.5鈥13.0 lm), and its distribution in mixed forests (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015).

Indeed, A. griseoumbonata is morphologically similar to A. shennongjiana and they share a slender basidioma with an umbonate pileus, globose to subglobose basidiospores and a similar structure of the volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. griseoumbonata differs from A. shennongjiana by its darker-colored pileus and is found in coniferous or mixed forests.\\nThe European A. vaginata var. vaginata is similar to A. shennongjiana in appearance, but A. vaginata var. vaginata has a robust basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus with rela- tively shorter striations on the margin and a relatively thicker volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are some- what similar to A. shennongjiana. However, A. ovalispora has a robuster basidioma, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm), a more robust volva on the stipe base, and occurs in more southern regions (Boedijn 1951; this study). Amanita pseudovagi- nata possesses a relatively paler-colored pileus and sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) (Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang\\nand Doi 1999).\\n \\n',\n",

Based on these characters, we treated the Chinese collections listed in Yang (2005) as A. vagi- nata var. vaginata for the time being. Unfortunately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from these Chi- nese collections.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not suggest any species closely related to A. vaginata var. vaginata. In addition, HKAS 56255, treated as A. vaginata var. vaginata by Yang (2015), should be A.  battarrae  (Fig. 1b).

Neither did Gilbert (1940) formally designate a type, but he illustrated five basidiospores of this species based on the collection made by S. Imai in the Nopporo forests on October 11, 1931. We examined two fragments of this collection but, unfortunately, no basid- iospores were observed. In our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. clarisquamosa is found to be related to A. volvata. However, collections of A. volvata listed under A. brunneomaculata have basidioma with an obvious reddish brown color change when bruised or injured, and is documented as being found in mixed forests in North American (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).

When basidioma agaricoid, pileus applanate, pileal margin non- striate, appendiculate, context white to cream, becoming vinaceous-buff when bruised; volval remnants on pileus present; lamellae free, white to cream, lamellulae truncate; stipe subcylindric, stipe base turbinate; volval remnants on stipe base indistinct, as soft warts or small, marfinate rim; annulus present; basidia thin-walled; basidiospores amy- loid; clamps absent in all parts of basidioma. When basidioma sequestrate, basidioma hypogeous to emergent, sequestrate and stipitate; pileus subglobose, oval or pulv- inate, pileal margin enrolled and in contact with stipe, without exposing hymenium, context white, unchanging or becoming yellow when injured; volval remnants on pileus usually absent; gleba beige to brownish, loculate; stipe subcylindric and tapering downward, with its apex not extending to top of gleba; volval remnants on stipe base shortly limbate; annulus absent; basidia thick-walled when mature; basidiospores statismosporic, thin-walled, smooth; clamps absent in all parts of basidioma. On sandy soil, only known in south-western and western Australia and puta- tively associated with ectomycorhizal partners of Euca- lyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton.\\nCommentary: Previous data and our multi-locus phylo- genetic study indicate that eight sequestrate species are currently  known  in  Amanita  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and\\n \\nHorak 1992; Bougher 1999; Bougher and Lebel 2002; Hallen et al. 2004; Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017). Of these, A. arenaria was described as belonging to Torrendia and was then transferred to Amanita by Justo et al. (2010). It clustered with two agaricoid species, A. lesueurii E.\\nM. Davison and A. wadjukiorum E. M. Davison, originally described from Western Australia and assigned to the stirps Strobiliformis of A. sect.  Lepidella  sensu  Bas  (Davison et al. 2013), as a distinct clade with strong statistic support. Furthermore, species in this clade are characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidiomata, smooth basid- iospores; the absence of clamps and their distributions in south-western and western Australia in association with Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton. We therefore treated this clade as a novel section.\\nOur multigene-phylogenetic data (Fig. 1a) strongly indicate that A. sect. Arenariae shares a common ancestor with A. sect. Phalloideae, sect. Validae and sect. Strobili- formes. Fungi from these sections usually have amyloid basidiospores. However, this is not the case for the species\\nA.\\tarenaria. Justo et al. (2010) suggested that A. arenaria probably evolved from an amyloid-spored ancestor but this character was lost during the gasteromycetation process. To date, no species of A. sect. Arenariae has been reported from China.\\nAmanita  sect.  Phalloideae  (Fr.)  Que麓l.,  Me麓m.  Soc.  Emul. Montbe麓liard, Ser.

Phal- loideae could be separated into three subclades with high support (lethal Amanita subclade, A. hesleri-A. zangii subclade, and A. pseudogemmata-A. ballerina subclade), which may be treated as separate subsections. However, we will not formally propose such taxonomic changes until more  taxa  are  studied.  To  date,  15  species   of   A.  sect. Phalloideae have been reported from China, including one novel species and 14 known ones. Amanita subjun- quillea var. alba Zhu L.

Yang et al., separately.\\nThe lethal Amanita subclade includes all the lethal Amanita, which contain cyclopetide toxins and can cause fatal poisoning (Cai et al. 2014; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2014, 2016; Tang et al. 2016). The fatalities caused by lethal Amanita species are presented in Fig. 35. Species in this subclade are characterized by a non-striate pileus rarely covered membranous volval remnants, attenuate lamellulae, a basal bulb with a limbate volva and the absence of clamps. To date, 12 lethal Amanita species have been found in China (see below).\\nOnly two species, A. hesleri and A. zangii, were rec- ognized from the Amanita hesleri Bas subclade, and both were previously assigned to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969). Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both should be in A. sect. Phalloideae (Cai et al. 2014; Figs. 1b, S11), although neither amatoxins nor phallotoxins were detected in the basidiomata of A. zangii (Cai et al. 2014). Species in this subclade are characterized by their subconical to flat verrucose, felty to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal margins, slenderly clavate to subfusiform base covered with floccose or warted volval remnants and the absence of clamps. To date, only A. zangii has been found in China (see below). Currently, four species are known from the A. pseudo- gemmata subclade: A. pseudogemmata Hongo, A. levistri- ata D. T. Jenkins, A. ballerina Raspe麓 et al. and A. franzii Zhu L. Yang et al. (Figs. 1b, S11). Species in this subclade are characterized by their striate pileal margins, truncate to nearly truncate lamellulae, marginate to sublimbate bulbs, (weakly) amyloid basidiospores and the absence of clamps. Amatoxins or phallotoxins have not been detected in A. pseudogemmata, A. ballerina and A. franzii (Cai et al.\\n \\n2014; Thongbai et al. 2017).

Phalloideae and is closely related to A. ballerina. However, A. ballerina can be distinguished from A. franzii by its relatively smaller basidioma and a white pileus covered with white to cream patchy volval remnants (Thongbai et al. 2017).\\nAmanita pseudogemmata is comparable to A. franzii in the marginate basal bulb. However, A. pseudogemmata differs from A. franzii by its yellow pileus covered with yellow to yellow-brown volval remnants, and a yellow stipe with its basal bulb covered with collar-like, white to yellowish volval remnants (Hongo 1974b; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nThe marginate bulb of Amanita franzii and the nature of the volval remnants are reminiscent of species of A. sub- sect. Limbatulae, including A. mutabilis Beardslee, A. parva (Murrill) Murrill, and A. praelongispora (Murrill) Murrill, which were described from the USA. However, these American taxa have sublimbate stipe bases and pro- portionally narrower basidiospores (Beardslee 1919; Mur- rill 1941, 1945; Bas 1969; Jenkins 1979, 1986; Tulloss\\n \\n\\n \\n1984). In addition, the latter two species have clamps (Beardslee 1919; Murrill 1941, 1945; Bas 1969; Jenkins\\n1979, 1986; Tulloss 1984).\\n',\n",

(2010), and subsequently reported from Thailand (Thongbai et al. 2017). This species is a member of the lethal Amanita subclade in A. sect. Phal- loideae. Cyclopetide toxins, including a-amanitin, b- amanitin and phalloidin, have been detected in the basid- ioma of A. fuligineoides, thus, acute liver failure would be caused by ingestion of this species (Chen et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016; Thongbai et al. 2017).\\nOur phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. fuligineoides is closely related to A. brunneitoxicaria Thongbai et al., which is in agreement with the conclusions of Thongbai et al. (2017). However, A. brunneitoxicaria differs from A. fuligineoides by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 3.5鈥4.5 in diam., a paler colored\\n \\nstipe (white to pale grayish brown) and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.9鈥9.8 9 6.8鈥7.7 lm, Q = 1.2鈥\\n1.42, Qm = 1.27 卤 0.3) (Thongbai et al. 2017).

This  species  is  deadly  poisonous (Kawase et al. 1992; Imazeki et al. 1988; Chen et al. 2016; Tang     et al. 2016). The albino form of A. subjunquillea was treated  as  A.  subjunquillea   var.   alba   by   Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015). Since few genetic differences between the albino form and the non-albino form are present, we treat A. subjunquillea var. alba as a synonym of A. sub- junquillea var. subjunquillea (Cai et al. 2014).\\n \\nPhylogenetically, A. subjunquillea is closely related to\\nA. phalloides (Vaill.:Fr.) Link (Fig. 1b). Indeed, they are also morphologically similar to each other. However, A. phalloides differs from A. subjunquillea in its robust basidioma and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.29, Qm = 1.19 卤 0.06) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

It is associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nPhylogenetically, A. brunneostrobilipes clustered as a distinct clade in A. sect. Roanokenses, away from other species (Fig. 1b). Amanita brunneostrobilipes is similar to\\nA. timida Corner & Bas, a species described from Singa- pore, in the color of the basidioma and recurved squamules on the stipe base. However, the latter can be distinguished by its white pileus with a pinkish tinge, broad ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) and the common presence of clamps (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita brunneostrobilipes is comparable to A. stro- bilipes Thongbai et al. Bin in that they share a strobiliform basal bulb. However, A. strobilipes, described from Thai- land, differs from A. brunneostrobilipes by its darker col- ored (dark gray) cones to pyramids on the pileus, a more appendiculate pileus margin and a non-radicating basal bulb (Li et al. 2016).\\n',\n",

It is characterized by its gray pileus covered with pyramidal volval remnants, a distinctly radicating stipe base with its upper part covered with inconspicuous volval remnants, ellipsoid basidiospores (8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), the pres- ence of clamps and occurrence in temperate forests.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), A. miculifera was recognized as two phylogenetic species (HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425) based on PTP analy- sis. Because only subtle morphological differences were observed between HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425 (ba- sidiospores   for   HKAS   100515   are   [150/3/1] 8.5鈥11.0  9 5.5鈥7.0 lm,  Q =  1.3鈥1.7,   Qm  = 1.5 卤 0.09;\\nbasidiospores  for  HKAS  101425  are  [20/1/1]   8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.32鈥1.6, Qm = 1.47 卤 0.08),\\nwe treat them as a single species, A. miculifera, which is also supported by GCPSR analysis (Fig. 2).\\nOur ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that\\nA. miculifera is closely related to A. cf. vestita. However, a specimen of A. cf. vestita (HKAS 80175) listed under A. vestita, has a non-radicating basal bulb and no clamps.\\n \\nAmanita miculifera can be confused with A. onusta (Howe) Sacc., but the latter differs in its relatively larger and darker colored pyramids on the pileus, dark gray to brownish gray, warted or recurred volval remnants on the stipe base often arranged in rings, and a less prominently radicating stipe base (Bas 1969; Bas and Hatanaka 1984; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita japonica is morphologically similar to A. miculifera in its gray pileus, a more or less radicating stipe base and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores. However, A. japonica has pyramidal to floccose volval remnants on the pileus and a napiform stipe base slightly radicating, lacking distinct pesudorhiza (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014). In China, A. heishidingensis is compa- rable to A. miculifera in its gray pileus covered with pyramidal volval remnants. However, A. heishidingensis has paler volval remnants on the pileus and a napiform stipe base not distinctly radicating. In addition, A. heishidingensis occurs in early spring (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015).\\n',\n",

This species was initially treated as a lethal amanita of A. sect. Phalloideae (Yang and Doi 1999; Yang and Li 2001; Yang 2005). However, phylogenetic evidence, coupled with the absence of amatoxins and phallotoxins, and its fresh basidioma lacking a yellow reaction to 5% KOH solution suggested it belonged to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (Cai et al. 2014). Amanita oberwinklerana is poisonous and can cause acute renal failure (Fu et al. 2017).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2), spec- imens labeled as A. oberwinkerana split into two closely related subclades (the HKAS 80150 subclade and the HKAS 100611 subclade) based on GCPSR analysis. However, no distinct and stable morphological differences were found to exist between the specimens in these two subclades. Thus, we treat them as a single species, A. oberwinkerana. Ecologically, species from the HKAS 80150 clade are found in central, eastern, southern and southeastern China, while those from the HKAS 100611 clade are mainly found in central and northeastern China. These two subclades may represent different geographic populations of A. oberwinkerana. Its phylogenetically related species are as yet unknown (Fig. 1b). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line draw- ings and images of A. oberwinklerana see Yang and Doi (1999), Yang and Li (2001), and Yang (2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

It grows in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Picea and Abies.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis (Figs. 1b, S12), A. pyra- midata is related to A. rubiginosa Cai et al., A. avel- laneifolia Yang et al. and A. magniverrucata Thiers & Ammirati. However, A. rubiginosa has a basal bulb often with a reddish tinge, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8,  Q = 1.15  鈥1.43,  Qm = 1.29\\n卤 0.72) and forms associations with Castanopsis, Litho- carpus, Quercus and Pinus. Amanita avellaneifolia has a dirty white to cream pileus with granular to conical volval remnants, biscuit colored lamellae, and forms association with Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis. Amanita magniver- rucata has a slender basidioma, a relatively pale pileus, volval remnants on the pileus that are at first a thick and rather smooth covering over the entire pileus, becoming areolate and later appearing as larger conspicuous pyra- midal warts, and relatively narrower basidiospores (8.0鈥12.6  9 5.8鈥8.0  lm)   (Thiers   and   Ammirati 1982;\\nTulloss 2009).\\nThe size and form of basidiospores of A. pyramidata is comparable to A. berkeleyi and A. eriophora (Berk.) E.\\nJ. Gilbert, both described from India (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar     et al. 1990). However, clamps are absent in the two Indian species (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990).

However, the latter can be easily distinguished by its dirty white to cream pileus covered with small granular to conical, dirty white to grayish white squamules and biscuit to flesh-colored lamellae.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita rubiginosa is similar to A. japonica in its medium-sized basidioma, and gray pileus densely covered with grayish truncate-pyramidal verrucose to subconical squamules. However, A. japonica possesses a fusiform- rooting to subclavate basal bulb covered with floccose- pulverulent volval remnants, a non-gelatinized pileipellis and relatively narrower basidiospores (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014).\\nAmanita rubiginosa resembles A. heishidingensis in appearance (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015). However, A. heishidingensis has a relatively larger and paler (dirty white to whitish) basidioma, and a subclavate to ventricose basal bulb covered with pale yellow to pale brownish gray, subfelty to subtomentose volval remnants (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015). In addition, A. heishidingensis occurs in the early spring, while A. rubiginosa grows in summer and autumn (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita griseoverrucosa Zhu L. Yang was originally placed in A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) based on morphological studies (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015), and is allocated to A. sect. Strobiliformes in this study. It is comparable to A. rubiginosa, however, A. griseoverrucosa can be distinguished from A. rubiginosa by its white to grayish basal bulb covered with gray, grayish to whitish, verrucose or irregular formed volval remnants, and the absence of clamps (Yang 1997, 2004, 2005, 2015; see below).\\n',\n",

Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not suggest any species closely related to A. sphaerobulbosa.\\nAmanita sphaerobulbosa is similar to the North Amer- ican species A. abrupta Peck, however, A. abrupta has narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Bas\\n1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; Yang and Doi 1999). Furthermore, the apical part of the warts on the pileus of A. sphaerobulbosa has many vascular hyphae and inflated cells, which is not the case in A. abrupta (Bas 1969; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nAmanita sphaerobulbosa is comparable to A. kotohi- raensis, but the latter has felted to patch-like volval rem- nants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements, a fragile and fugacious annulus, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), and a pungent odor (Nagasawa and Mitani 2000; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).

Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. vestita is related to A. cinereovelata Hosen and A. griseofarinosa. They are morphologically similar. How- ever, A. cinereovelata is found in Shorea forests and differs from A. vestita in its globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.0鈥10.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) and the presence of clamps (Hosen et al. 2015). Amanita griseofarinosa has a relatively larger basidioma and  broader  basidiospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo\\n1987; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Ima- zeki et al. 2011).\\nMorphologically, A. vestita is very similar to A. cf. vestita. Furthermore, the specimen of A. cf. vestita (HKAS 80175) has a small pileus ca. 3 cm diam., gray, floccose volval remnants on the pileus forming verrucae at the center; a non-radicating basal bulb with its upper part covered with irregularly arranged, felty, floccose to coni- cal, white to grayish squamules, ellipsoid basidiospores measuring [200/4/2] (7.0鈥) 8.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 (鈥8.0) lm,\\nQ = (1.27鈥) 1.33鈥1.67 (鈥1.75), Qm = 1.50 卤 0.10 and no\\nclamps.

In addition, species in this clade share common characters\\n \\nmentioned above in the diagnosis, and we therefore treat it as a distinct section. Amanita sect.

It is found in subalpine forests together with Abies or Picea.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. cinereoradicata is closely related to A. aspericeps. For comparisons between A. cinereoradicata and A. aspericeps see the commentary on A. aspericeps.\\nYuan and Sun (1995) applied the name 鈥樷楢. cinere- opannosa鈥欌 to the Chinese materials. However, our study suggests that the Chinese taxon differs from the North American A. cinereopannosa Bas both phylogenetically and morphologically. Phylogenetically, A. cinereoradicata and A. cinereopannosa clustered as two separated clades\\n \\n(Fig. 1b). Morphologically, A. cinereopannosa from the USA has a relatively paler pileus, firmer volval remnants on the pileus and relatively smaller basidiospores, being [50/3/3] (8.0鈥) 8.5鈥11.0 (鈥14.7) 9 5.0鈥6.0 (鈥7.5) lm (Bas\\n1969; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study). The European A. strobiliformis (Paul. ex. Vitt.) Bertillon can also be confused with A. cinereoradicata. However, A. strobiliformis has a paler pileus, felted and paler volval remnants on the pileus and relatively larger basidiospores [50/2/2] (9.0鈥) 9.5鈥13.0 (鈥17.5)  9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥8.5 (鈥10) lm\\n(Bas 1969; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).\\n',\n",

It is noteworthy that the color of A. citrinoannulata is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, brown, grayish brown to dark brown.\\nPhylogenetically, A. citrinoannulata is closely related and morphologically similar to the European species A. spissa (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Fig. 1b). However, A. spissa differs from A. citrinoannulata in its robust basidioma, a gray pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking snakeskin-like, yellow squamules, white to dirty white volval remnants on the stipe base and a white annulus (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015). Furthermore, the reddish discoloration following bruising of A. spissa only occurs on the stipe surface, while in A. citrinoannulata the discoloration can occur over all\\n \\n\\n \\nparts of the basidioma (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J.\\nE. Lange and A. flavorubens (Berk. & Mont.) Sacc. are morphologically similar to A. citrinoannulata in that they share basidiomata with red discoloration on bruising, and yellow annuli. However, A. rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J. E. Lange has a grayish brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking yel- low, snakeskin-like squamules, and an inflated basal bulb glabrous or covered with dirty white, grayish to brown volval remnants (Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita flavorubens has a brown to yellow pileus covered with patchy, lemon yellow volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores (9.4鈥10.2 9 6.2鈥7.0 lm) (Atkinson 1902; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAdditional species in A. sect. Validae sharing basid- iomata with more or less red discoloration when bruised include A. orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N. Lakh., A. rubescens Pers. and A. excelsa (Fr.: Fr.) Bertillon. However, A. orsonii and A. rubescens have a brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a dirty white to grayish stipe lacking yellow squamules above the annulus, and a white annulus often with a reddish tinge (Gilbert 1940; Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss et al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa, a species described from Sweden, has a robust basidioma with a red tinge only occurring at the stipe base, a white stipe lacking yellow squamules, and a white to dirty white annulus (Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Poumarat 2004).\\nBasidiomata of A. citrinoannulata with a gray-brown to gray pileus are also comparable to those of A. fritillaria Sacc. and A. spissacea S. Imai. However, the basidiomata of the latter two species do not change color when injured (Imai  1933,  1938;  Hongo  1959;  Corner  and  Bas  1962;\\nImazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988,  2011;\\nKumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015). Furthermore, A. fritillaria has a white to dirty white stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, a basal bulb covered with conical, verrucose to floccose, blackish, dark gray to gray- brown volval remnants and a dirty white to gray annulus (Corner and Bas 1962; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang  2005, 2015; this study). Amanita spissacea possesses a dirty white to gray stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, pulverulent to floccose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants on the stipe base, a grayish annulus and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Imazeki and\\nHongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; this study).\\n \\n',\n",

It is predominantly associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S14), HKAS 38419 (ITS = AY436474), which was identified as Amanita sp. 1 in Zhang et al. (2004), clustered within A. flavosquamosa with strong support (MLB = 100%). Therefore, we assign HKAS 38419 to A. flavosquamosa. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. flavosquamosa (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can be confused with A. detersa because of the color and form of the basidiomata, and the volval remnants on the pileus. However, A. detersa pos- sesses a relatively slender basidioma, a thinner but not fragile annulus, pulverulent yellow volval remnants on the stipe base  and  relatively  smaller  basidiospores (7.0鈥8.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is similar to A. flavipes in appearance, but the latter differs by its yellower basidioma and slightly narrower basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 5.5鈥\\n7.0 lm) (Imai 1933; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Tulloss et al. 2001).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa is also similar to A. franchetii. However, A. franchetii has a robuster basidioma, firmer volval remnants, and broad ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Contu 2000a; Galli\\n2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can also be confused with the North American A. augusta, but the latter differs in its yellow annulus, basal bulb distinctly rufescent in age and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥9.3 9 6.0鈥6.8 lm, Q = 1.27鈥1.57) (Bojantchev and Davis 2013).\\n',\n",

JAPAN. HOKKAIDO: Nopporo, altitude unknown, 10 October 1926, S. Imai (TYPE).\\nCommentary: Imai (1933) described A. sepiacea from Japan without assignment of a type. Hongo (1959) desig- nated a type for the species; it was collected by S. Imai from Nopporo, Hokkaido on 10 October 1926. We exam- ined the type and found that most basidiospores had col- lapsed, and only a few basidiospores could be measured. They were [15/1/1] 7.5鈥9.5 (鈥10.5)  9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥7.2 (鈥7.5)\\nlm,   Q = (1.1鈥)   1.14鈥1.4   (鈥1.45),   Qm = 1.27 卤 0.1,\\nbroadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled A. sepiacea were supported as two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Since morphological differences between them were only subtle, we consider them to be a single species, A. sepiacea. No closely related species of A. sepiacea were detected in our current study (Fig. 1b). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A.  sepiacea  see  Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015).\\n',\n",

FRANCE: altitude and date unknown, Jian-Ping Xu 29 (HKAS 100533).\\nCommentary: Amanita spissa was treated as a synonym or infraspecific taxa under A. excelsa (Corner and Bas 1962;  Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Pou- marat 2004). However, our molecular phylogenetic data indicate that these should be two distinct species, lacking a close relationship (Fig. 1b). Amanita spissa is probably widely distributed throughout Eurasia, but in China has only been found in the northeastern (Yang 2015; Fig. 2).\\nPhylogenetically, A. spissa is related to A. citrinoannu- lata (Fig. 1b), and a comparison between these two species is presented in the commentary on A. citrinoannulata. The red-color change on the stipe of A. spissa is comparable to that in A. orsonii and A. rubescens. However, in the latter two species, all parts of the basidiomata color red when\\n \\n\\n \\ninjured, and all have a lighter colored pileus (Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss\\net al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. rubescens is found in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and central, northern, northwestern and southwestern regions of China (Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study), while A. orsonii is found in India, Japan and central, eastern and southwestern regions of China (Kumar et al. 1990; Tulloss et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\n']"

Furthermore, it is found in subalpine forests dominated by Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. flavopantherina is, with low support, related to A. mus- caria, A. regalis, A. persicina, A. ibotengutake, A. gemmata and A. concentrica. However, these species differ mor- phologically from A. flavopantherina in the following ways. Amanita muscaria, a species described from Europe and also found in northern, northeastern and northwestern China, has a red pileus and relatively narrower basid- iospores     measuring     9.0鈥12.5  9 7.0鈥8.5  lm  (Gilbert\\n1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000;\\nGalli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). The European A. regalis has a brown pileus covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita persicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus, cream lamellae with a pinkish  tint  and  relatively  narrower  basidiospores\\n \\n(9.4鈥12.7 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986;  Tulloss et al. 2015). Amanita ibotengutake has white to grayish volval remnants on the pileus, smaller basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.23鈥1.38, Qm = 1.32 卤\\n0.06), and is found in temperate forests (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015). Specimens of A. gemmata listed under A. concentrica differ from A. concentrica by their grayish yellow to yellowish pilei, volval remnants on the pileus composed primarily of subradically arranged elements with very abundant to nearly dominant filamentous hyphae, narrower basidiospores (9.5鈥12.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm), and absence of clamps. The comparisons between A. concen- trica and A. flavopantherina are given in commentary on A. concentrica.\\nAmanita flavopantherina is easily confused with A. griseopantherina Yang-Yang Cui et al. as they have similar appearance and habitats, and for comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. griseopantherina.\\nA species similar to A. flavopantherina and sharing a basidioma with clamps, also found in Abies forest is A. pakistanica Tulloss et al., but the latter differs by its umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, white, detersile volval remnants, and relatively narrower basid- iospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7.0鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). Our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) suggests that they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita subglobosa Zhu L. Yang and A. pantherina (DC.) Krombh. are also similar to A. flavopantherina in their brown basidiomata. However, A. subglobosa has white volval remnants on the pileus and is dominant in forests of Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower alti- tudes (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina has narrower   basidiospores   and   no   clamps    (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000;\\nWasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Molecular phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S6) indicate that they are distinct species.\\n']\n",

Amanita regalis has yellow volval remnants on the pileus and relatively broader basidiospores (9鈥11 9 7鈥8 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita per- sicina has a pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored pileus covered with yellowish to tannish, floccose-fibrillose patches, cream lamellae with pinkish tint, a stipe whose context turns yellowish when cut or bruised and relatively larger basidiospores (9.4鈥12.7 9 7鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\nFor differences between A. ibotengutake and A. flavopantherina see the commentary on A. flavopantherina.

This species is described from Europe and represents the type species of the genus Amanita (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Jenkins and Petersen 1976; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang\\n2005, 2015). Yang and Oberwinkler (1999) provided a detailed study on the basidiomal development and anatomy of A. muscaria.\\nAmanita muscaria was traditionally treated as a single morphospecies with several varieties (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Wasser 2000; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Geml et al. 2006, 2008) and has been reported as a common, widespread, easily identifiable, ecologically plastic fungus with a wide niche (Coker 1917; Jenkins 1977, 1986; Reid 1980; Thiers 1982; Garrido 1986;\\n \\n\\n \\nReid and Eicker 1991; Ridley 1991; Tulloss et al. 1995; Bhatt et al. 2003; Oda et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; Vargas et al. 2017). However, the studies of Geml et al. (2006) and Geml et al. (2008) indicated that the mor- phospecies A. muscaria represents more than one phylo- genetic species.\\nIn    the    multi-locus    analysis    (ITS ? b-tubu-    lin ? LSU ? ef1-a) of Geml et al. (2008), the morphos- pecies A. muscaria was divided into eight clades with strong inter- and intracontinental phylogeographic struc- ture. In our ITS analysis (Fig. S6), our Chinese specimens, HMJAU 4548, HMJAU 4549, and HKAS 61888, clustered\\nwithin the clade II of Geml et al. (2008), which contained many specimens from Eurasia and Alaska.\\nIn our multi-locus analysis (Fig. 1b), A. muscaria was found to be closely related to A. persicina. However, A. persicina has a relatively paler colored (pastel-red to light orange or melon-colored) pileus covered with pale yellow to yellowish-tan to tan, floccose-fibrillose patches and cream lamellae with a pinkish tint (Jenkins 1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).\\n']\n",

How- ever, A. elata has a relatively paler pileus (yellowish- brown) covered with floccose to pulverulent volval rem- nants, no annulus and relatively larger basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 7鈥9 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015).\\nIn our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. gleocys- tidiosa clustered within the monophyletic clade of A. sychnopyramis and because of this, coupled with the presence of the annulus mentioned in Li et al. (2016), led us to treat it as a synonym of A. sychnopyramis f. suban- nulata. The presence  of cystidia in A. gleocystidiosa (Li  et al. 2016) could be a misinterpretation.\\n \\n\\n \\nFor detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. sychnopyramis f. subannulata see Yang (1997, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita sect.

Currently only known in Southern Hemisphere in forests with Nothofagus, Euca- lyptus, etc.\\nCommentary: To date, there is evidence that eight sequestrate species are members of Amanita, namely A. arenaria (O. K. Mill. & E. Horak) Justo, A. torrendii Justo,\\nA.\\tgrandis (Bougher) Justo, A. inculta (Bougher) Justo, A. pseudoinculta Justo, A. oleosa (Bougher & T. Lebel) Justo,\\nA. grandispora (G. W.

Of these sequestrate species, six (A. grandis, A. inculta, A. pseudoinculta, A. oleosa, A. grandispora and A. nouhrae) clustered with four agaricoid species (A. morenoi Raithelh.,\\nA.\\tmuriniflammea Tulloss, A.

Fur- thermore, species in this clade can be characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidioma, thick-walled and ornamented, or thin-walled and smooth basidiospores, the presence of clamps and distributions through the Southern Hemisphere in forests with Nothofagus and Eucalyptus. Therefore, we treated this clade as a novel section. Bougher and Lebel (2002) proposed the genus Amarrendia typified by Amarrendia oleosa. Then Justo et al. (2010) treated Amarrendia as a synonym of Amanita located in 鈥樷楢mar- rendia clade鈥欌 without section assignment by molecular data. In our study, we named this section  as  Amanita  sect. Amarrendiae based on the basionym of Amarrendia. Based  on  our  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. 1a,  b),  A. sect. Amarrendiae was sister to A. sect. Amanita.\\nAlthough no species from A. sect.

In our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. pseudoinculta  is  closely  related  to  A.  inculta  in  A. sect. Amarrendiae. However, A. inculta differs from A. pseudoinculta in that its gleba often fragments as the stipe\\n \\n\\nFig. 7 Basidiospores of Amanita pseudoinculta (PERTH 08105731).

How- ever, A. torrendii, a species in A. sect. Caesareae, differs from A. pseudoinculta by its narrower basidiospores (12.6鈥16.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm, Q = 2.37) and distribution in southern Europe and northern Africa in association with Pinus,  Larix  and  Quercus  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and Horak 1992; Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandis has a relatively larger pileus (up to 4 cm in diam.) expanding outwards from stipe exposing much of the lower gleba, and a cylindrical stipe with its apex extending through the entire gleba to the top of the pileus (Bougher 1999; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita oleosa has an astipitate basidioma, locules in the gleba filled with liquid, and rel- atively broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basid- iospores (12.5鈥15.0 9 9.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = 1.39) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita grandispora has an astipitate basidioma and broader, broadly ellipsoid to subovoid basidiospores (13.0鈥17.0 9 9.5鈥11.5 lm, Q = 1.43) (Bougher and Lebel 2002; Justo et al. 2010). Amanita nouhrae has distinctly ornamented, subglobose to deformed basidiospores  (14.0鈥20.0 9 12.5鈥17.5 lm, Q = 1.05鈥1.25), is distributed in northern Patagonia and is associated with Nothofagus antarctica (Truong et al. 2017).\\nAmanita umbrinella E.-J.

In the study of Truong et al. (2017) and in our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), four agaricoid species in A. sect. Amar- rendiae, including A. morenoi, A. muriniflammea, A. umbrinella and A. merxmuelleri, clustered as separated lineages and represented different species.

To date, no sequestrate taxa of this section have been reported from China. Previous studies and our multi-locus phylogenetic data indicate that the genus Torrendia is a synonym of A. sect. Caesareae (Fig. 1b) (Bas 1975; Tul-\\nloss 2009; Justo et al. 2010).\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

Unfortu- nately, we were unable to generate DNA sequences from it. Amanita caesareoides is phylogenetically closely rela- ted and morphologically similar to the European A. cae- sarea (Fig. 1b). Examination of European specimens of A. caesarea has revealed that Amanita caesarea can be dis- tinguished from A. caesareoides by its non-umbonate pileus with relatively shorter striations on its margin, a short, robust stipe and larger basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

In our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), A. esculenta was found to be related to A. hunanensis Y. B. Peng & L. J. Liu, A. yua- niana Zhu L. Yang and A. spreta (Peck) Sacc. However, these species can be distinguished from A. esculenta through   the   following   characters.   A.   hunanensis  and\\nA. yuaniana both have a pileus with distinct innate spots or speckles  (Peng  and  Liu  1981;  Yang  1994,   1997,  2005, 2015; Yang and Zhang 2002). Amanita spreta, described from the USA, differs from A. esculenta by its relatively paler colored pileus (whitish or pale brown) and narrower,   elongate   to   cylindric   basidiospores  (Murrill\\n \\n1913; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).

We have checked a specimen of A. javanica from Malaysia.

However, these species can be distinguished from A. longistriata in the following ways. Amanita incarnatifolia has relatively shorter striations on the pileus margin, relatively narrower basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 7.0鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.31鈥1.5,  Qm = 1.4 卤 0.07) and is dominant in  pine, broad-leaved or mixed forests with Pinaceae and Fagaceae (Imazeki and Toki 1955; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana has a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus and white to off-white lamellae (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993). Amanita cf. incarnatifolia has relatively narrower basidiospores (10.0鈥13.5 9 8.0鈥10.0 lm, Q = 1.25鈥1.5, Qm = 1.36 卤 0.08) and is dominant in broad-leaved or mixed forests, but more collections are needed to allow a formal description of A. cf. incarnatifolia.\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A. longistriata are given in Yang (2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

KUALA  LUMPUR: Kepong,\\naltitude  unknown,  6  October  1999,  Farid  2830  (FRIM\\n2830).\\nCommentary: Amanita princeps was described from Singapore by Corner and Bas (1962), and subsequently reported from China, India, Malaysia and Thailand (Yang 2005, 2015; Sanmee et al. 2008; Bhatt et al. 2017; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Little information was known of this species from or near its type locality until Tang et al. (2018). Tang et al. (2018) identified A. princeps with both morphological and molecular evidence based on materials from Malaysia (FRIM 62849 and FRIM 2811), which were collected near its type locality and which were morpho- logically consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the Chi- nese specimens clustered with A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849) as two subclades based on PTP analysis. We have examined a specimen of A. princeps from Malaysia (FRIM 62849), and the basidiospores were [20/1/1] 8.5鈥10.5 (鈥11.5) 9 7.0鈥10.0 (鈥11.5) lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.18\\n(鈥1.29), Qm = 1.09 卤 0.06. There are subtle morphologi- cal differences between specimens in the two subclades from China and Malaysia, but they share a large basidioma, a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer layer often cracking and peeling into thin patches, and globose, sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores, all of which are consistent with the original description of A. princeps in Corner and Bas (1962). Consequently, we currently con- servatively treated the specimens in these two subclades as\\nA. princeps and submitted their DNA sequences to NCBI under that name. In addition, our phylogenetic data indicate that HKAS 60269, treated as Amanita sp. 8 in Yang (2015), should be A. princeps (Figs. 1b, 2).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. princeps was closely related to the Australian A. egregia D.\\nA. Reid. However, A. egregia has a white basidioma and has an Australian distribution in association with eucalypt trees (Reid 1978, 1980).\\nAmanita princeps can be easily confused with A. pseu- doprinceps Yang-Yang Cui et al. because of the yellow- brown pileus with short striations (0.25鈥0.3 R). However,\\nA. pseudoprinceps, a novel species described in this study, differs from A. princeps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 7鈥12 cm diam., and a white saccate volva with its outer surface not cracking into brownish patches.\\n \\nAmanita princeps is similar to A. aporema, but the latter has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., a more red-brown pileus with longer striations ca.\\n0.5 R, and a saccate volva on the stipe base with its outer surface white and not cracking into patches (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nDetailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species and images of A. princeps are given in Yang (2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

The latter was identified based on the collection RET-356-10 (ITS = MF928093)   by   Sa麓nchez-Ram麓谋rez   et   al.   (2015). Whether RET-356-10 represents A. rubroflava or a new taxon needs further morphological studies with more collections.\\nIn China, A. rubroflava can be confused with A. hemi- bapha (Zhang et al. 2004; Yang 2005). Our ITS phyloge- netic analysis (Fig. S7) showed that the collection HKAS 38416 (ITS = AY436460), identified as A. hemibapha in Zhang et al. (2004) and Yang (2005), clustered within the\\nA. rubroflava clade with strong support. Consequently, HKAS 38416 should be determined as A. rubroflava. In addition, A. hemibapha differs morphologically from A. rubroflava by its non-umbonate pileus, narrower basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 5.5鈥6.5) and its tropical distribution (Gilbert 1941a; Pegler 1986; Vrinda et al. 2005; Sanmee  et al. 2008; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubroflava is similar to A. caesareoides in that they share umbonate pilei and the basidiospores are of similar size, however, the latter has a more red to orange- red pileus and is dominant in temperate East Asia (Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988; Cho et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Endo et al. 2016).\\nAmanita caesarea and A. masasiensis Ha篓rk. & Saarim. are also comparable to A. rubroflava in their macroscopic appearance. However, the European A. caesarea has a robuster basidioma with an obviously shorter stipe, an orange pileus lacking an umbo and longer basidiospores (8.5鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu\\n2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita masasiensis, described from Tanzania, has a relatively smaller basid- ioma, a non-umbonate pileus, ellipsoid to elongate basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 6.0鈥7.0 lm), and is dominant in woodland often with trees of the genera Brachystegia, Combretum, Julbernardia, Syzygium and Uapaca (Ha篓rko篓- nen et al. 1994; Tang et al. 2015).\\n']\n",

How- ever, A. murrilliana has a white stipe and relatively broader basidiospores (7.8鈥8.6 9 11.7鈥13.3 lm) (Murrill 1941; Singer 1951; Jenkins 1979). Amanita esculenta has\\n \\nrelatively shorter striations (0.1 R) on the pileal margin and relatively longer basidiospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 7.5鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.24鈥1.45, Qm = 1.35 卤 0.09) (Matsuda and Hongo 1955; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011).

Commentary: Amanita yuaniana was described from China by Yang (1994). Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. yuaniana is related to A. hunanensis. However, A. hunanensis differs from A. yuaniana in the relatively longer striations on its margin (ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R) and fairly abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base (Peng and Liu 1981; Yang and Zhang 2002;\\nYang 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita esculenta and A. spreta are also morphologi- cally similar to A. yuaniana. However, A. esculenta can be distinguished from A. yuaniana by its pileus lacking innate speckles (Matsuda and Hongo 1955; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 2005, 2015; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita spreta, described form the USA, has a pileus lacking innate speckles and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.2鈥13.3 9 5.5鈥7 lm) (Murrill 1913; Coker 1917;\\nJenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).

Vaginatae is often difficult (Bas 1977). In this study, we documented 32 Chinese taxa from this section based on multi-locus phylogenetic, mor- phological and partial ecological evidence, including 13 novel species and 19 known taxa (17 species and two varieties). Amanita atrofusca Zhu L. Yang was treated as a novel synonym of A. umbrinolutea (Gillet) Bataille. The microscopic structure of the volva, including the arrange- ment and proportion of inflated cells and filamentous hyphae, seems to be one of the most important traits for the characterization of the species in this section. In addition, DNA sequences are very useful for delimitation of the species.\\n\\nKey to the species of Amanita sect.

This species is characterized by its gray-brown pileus without an umbo, longer striations up to 0.5 R on the pileal margin, sparse lamellae, a small, white saccate volva on stipe base, globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.5鈥11.0 9 9.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.05,  Qm = 1.03 卤 0.13), and the absence of clamps.\\nThe diagnosis mentioned in the protologue of this taxon (as Amanitopsis vaginata var. angustilamellata) was very brief, and since then few reliable descriptions have been made (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Pegler 1986;\\nYang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017). Consequently, the delimita- tion of A. angustilamellata remains poorly understand.\\nCorner and Bas (1962) mentioned that the narrow gills of this species may be an unreliable character. Pegler (1986) reported the presence of clamps in the pileipellis based on Sri Lankan materials, but this differed from the reports of Corner and Bas (1962) and Yang (2005). Boedijn (1951) and Lee (2017) did not mention the presence or absence of clamps of this species. Based on the protologue and reexamination of the type (FH 4712), HKAS 24158 was identified as A. angustilamellata by Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). In this study, we follow the treatments of\\nA. angustilamellata in Wei脽 et al. (1998) and Yang (2005). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of the Chinese A. angustilamel- lata see Yang (2005).\\nYang (2015) reported the presence of A. angustilamel- lata in China based on HKAS 83453. However, our multi- locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicated that HKAS 83453 grouped together with HKAS 89451 as a distinct clade, and collections in this clade had a more northern subtropical to temperate distribution compared with A. angustilamellata. Thus, HKAS 83453 and HKAS 89451 may represent a novel species, but its classification cannot be clarified until further collections are made to better estimate morphological characters and geographic distributions.\\n']\n",

In our multi-locus phyloge- netic data (Fig. 2), specimens of A. aff. brunneofuliginea from Europe and A. brunneofuliginea specimens from Asia split into two sister clades. These were identified as two phylogenetic species based on GCPSR analysis, but com- bined as a single phylogenetic species based on PTP analysis.\\nCollections of A. aff. brunneofuliginea have an umbonate, gray to grayish pileus ca. 5 cm in diam., stria- tions ca. 0.2鈥0.3 R on the pileal margin, cream to whitish lamellae, a white to grayish stipe ca. 11鈥15 cm long 9 0.5鈥1 cm diam., a saccate, easily broken volva with its outer surface dirty white with yellowish to ocheraceous spots and its inner surface dirty white, globose to subglobose basidiospores measuring [60/3/3] 11.0鈥13.0 9\\n10.0鈥12.0 (鈥12.5) lm, Q = 1.0鈥1.1, Qm = 1.05 卤 0.03, an\\nabsence of clamps and an association with trees of the genera Abies, Picea and Fagus. Amanita aff. brunneo- fuliginea can be distinguished from A. brunneofuliginea by its relatively smaller basidioma, a paler colored (grayish to gray) pileus, and globose to subglobose basidiospores. In this study, we therefore treat these taxa as two separate species: A. aff. brunneofuliginea and A. brunneofuliginea. Further study and more collections are necessary before\\nA.\\taff. brunneofuliginea can be formally described.

However, A. constricta has a relatively larger and robuster basidioma with a gray to brownish gray pileus ca. 5鈥13 cm in diam., lamellae at first white and then becoming gray, and gray lamellar edges. Moreover, A. constricta occurs during the winter months in the USA (Thiers and Ammirati 1982; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss 1994). Amanita cinnamomea has cinnamon lamellar edges and distributed in tropical forests with trees of Fagaceae (Thongbai et al. 2018).\\nAmanita tenuifulva, a novel species described in this study, is easily confused with A. changtuia. However, A. tenuifulva has a non-umbonate pileus and is found in the southern regions of China. The European A. fulva is similar to A. changtuia in the color of its pileus and the similar\\n \\nbasidiospores. However, A. fulva has a relatively shorter stipe, and a brownish, saccate volva with inflated cells dominant in the outer part (Contu 2000a, b; Massart 2000; Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita orientifulva also somewhat resembles A. changtuia in appearance.

Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that A. liquii is related to A. griseofolia, A. submembranacea and A. ceciliae. For discussions between A. liquii and A. griseo- folia see the commentary on A. griseofolia.

Singer.\\n \\nIndeed, they are similar morphologically in that they share a yellow pileus. However, the European A. crocea differs from A. orienticrocea by its obviously saffron orange pileus, white lamellae lacking a gray tinge and a stipe decorated with distinctly orange  squamules  (Gilbert  1940, 1941a; Tulloss 1997, 2000a; Contu 2000a; Massart 2000; Galli 2001).\\nIn China, A. orienticrocea is morphologically similar to\\nA. orientifulva Zhu L. Yang, M. Wei脽 & Oberw. and A. albidostipes Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang. However, A. orientifulva has a dark brown to red-brown pileus, brown to brownish lamellar edges, a dirty white stipe covered with red-brown to gray-brown squamules, brown patches on the outer surface of the volva, relatively larger basidiospores (10鈥14 9 9.5鈥13 lm), and is found in subalpine forests (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita albidostipes has a non-umbonate pileus, white lamellae without gray tinge when young, and the outer surface of the volva often has a brown tinge.\\nIn addition, A. subnudipes (Romagn.) Tulloss and A. romagnesiana Tulloss are also similar to A. orienticrocea. However, A. subnudipes has an orange pileus and relatively narrower   basidiospores    (8.9鈥12.2 9 7.5鈥10.5 lm, Q = 1.12鈥1.16) (Tulloss 2000a, b). Amanita romagnesiana has a non-umbonate, bright orange-tawny pileus, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (B 0.2 R), pale cream lamellae, and a pale brownish orange stipe decorated with pale orange floccules (Tulloss 1994, 2000a, b).\\n']\n",

In our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), specimens labeled as A. ovalispora split into three subclades, which were separated into three phylogenetic species based on PTP analysis. In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S8), A. subovalispora, a species described from Thailand (Thongbai et al. 2018), also clustered within the A. oval- ispora complex. Further studies are needed to classify the\\nA. ovalispora complex accurately.

Because there are abundant inflated cells in the outer part of the volva, the volva can easily be broken during the development of the basidioma. Specimens of A. retenta with entirely white basidiomata have also been collected in the field.\\nOur phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) did not uncover any species closely related to A. retenta. Amanita retenta is morphologically similar to A. nivalis, described from Europe. However, A. nivalis has a relatively shorter basidioma with its stipe ca. 4鈥8 cm long, and was descri- bed as a snow-bed agaric in association with Carex, Gal- ium and Polytrichum (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Watling 1985; Campo and Bizio 2000; Contu 2000b; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are also similar to A. retenta in macroscopic appearance. However, they can be separated from A. retenta in their broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm for A. ovalispora; 10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm for\\nA. pseudovaginata), and the inflated cells are concentrated\\n \\nin the inner part of the volva (Boedijn 1951; Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nThe white basidioma of A. retenta could be misidenti- fied as the European A. vaginata var. alba Gillet. For example, HKAS 82591 was erroneously treated as A. vaginata var. alba by Yang (2015) and should be a species of A. retenta based on our ITS  phylogenetic  analysis  (Fig. S8). However, A. vaginata var. alba differs from the white basidioma of A. retenta by the absence of volval remnants on the pileus, and the irregularly distributed, brownish spots on the outer surface of the volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Galli 2001).\\n']\n",

Indeed, A. tenuifulva is similar to A. fulva in their similarly colored basidioma.

Based on the literature and examinations of materials, A. fulva differs from A. tenuifulva in its relatively robust basidioma with a proportionally shorter stipe, and the structure of the volval remnants on the stipe base (Contu 2000a,  b;  Massart  2000;  Yang  et  al.  2004;  Yang  2005, 2015).\\nThe Chinese species, A. orientifulva, also has a brown basidioma. However, A. orientifulva differs from A. tenuifulva in its relatively robuster basidioma, larger basidiospores (10.0鈥14.0 9 9.5鈥13.0 lm) and scarce inflated cells in the outer part of the volval remnants on the stipe base (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

Amanita zonata can be confused with A. umbrinolutea because of the gray-brown pileus with an indistinct dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and similar basidiospores. However, A. umbrinolutea, a species described from Europe and also found in China, has a darker basidioma, brownish to gray-brown lamellar edges, obvious brown spots on the outer surface of the volva, and relatively larger basid- iospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 9.5鈥12.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a;\\nContu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001;\\nNeville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. umbrinolutea is dominant in temperate regions (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004;\\nYang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora, a species described from Indonesia, is similar to A. zonata in appearance and habitats, but the former can be distinguished from the latter by the grayer to darker gray pileus lacking an obvious dark-colored ring-like zone at the proximal end of the marginal striations, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm) (Boedijn\\n1951; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015).\\nIn China, A. brunneofuliginea is somewhat similar to A. zonata in the gray-brown pileus.

To keep the infrageneric taxonomic stability of Amanita (Tulloss et al. 2016), we follow the con- cept of A. subgen. Amanitina as circumscribed by Redhead et al.

This taxon\\nis often in association with trees of the family Pinaceae. Phylogenetically,  A.  brunneomaculata  is  sister  to  A.\\nlanigera Yang-Yang Cui et al. (Fig. 1b). For comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. lanig- era. Amanita clarisquamosa, A. volvata (Peck) Lloyd, and\\n \\nA. rufobrunnescens are also morphologically similar to A. brunneomaculata.

Amanita volvata, from the USA, has a basidioma with an obvious reddish brown color change when bruised or injured, a more floccose pileus, and a thicker subhymenium with 3鈥4 layers of inflated cells (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study). Furthermore, A. volvata is documented to be found in mixed forests in North Amer- ican (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study). Amanita rufobrunnescens has narrower basid- iospores (10.0鈥12.0 9 5.5鈥6.5 lm, Qm = 1.78  卤 0.17) and is dominant in subtropical forests with broad-leaved trees (Deng et al. 2016).\\n']\n",

This species belongs to the lethal Amanita subclade in A. sect. Phalloideae. Cyclope- tide toxins, in particular a-amanitin and b-amanitin, are\\n \\ndetected in all parts of the basidioma and at different stages of development (Deng et al. 2011; Xue  et al. 2011; Hu     et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014b; Chen et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2016). It is the leading cause of mushroom poisonings in Guangdong Province, China, where from 2000 to 2014, 22 cases of mushroom poisoning were reported, resulting in 89 affected individuals and 45 deaths (Yang and Li 2001; Deng et al. 2011; Xue et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2012; Cai et al. 2014; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2014, 2016; Li et al. 2014b; Tang et al. 2016).\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) shows that A. exitialis is sister to the North American A. subal- liacea (Murrill) Murrill (Cai et al. 2014). Examination of specimens of A. suballiacea from North America indi- cates  that  it  has  4-spored  basidia   and   smaller,  broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.2鈥1.4, Qm = 1.29 卤 0.08) (Murrill\\n1941; Jenkins 1979, 1986; this study). Furthermore, the outer layer of volval remnants on the stipe base in A. suballiacea is composed of wide filamentous hyphae up to 20 lm in diam., while those in A. exitialis are 2鈥7 lm in diam.

This spe- cies has caused at least five deaths (Zhang et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2011; Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2016), and high levels of cyclopetide toxins have been detected in the basidioma of A. pallidorosea (Li et al. 2014a; Tang et al. 2016).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled as A. pallidorosea split into two subclades based on GCPSR analysis.

Amanita due to its striate pileal margin, pulverulent volval remnants on the pileus, a marginate to sublimbate stipe base, and the absence of clamps (Hongo 1974b; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it should be in A. sect. Phalloideae having amyloid basidiospores. Careful reexamination of the col- lections cited above showed that the basidiospores are indeed amyloid, but only weakly.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S11), A. pseudogemmata is sister to A. levistriata. However, the latter differs morphologically in its relatively smaller basidioma with a ca. 1.7鈥3 cm in diam. pileus, volval remnants on the pileus as floccose patches at center, becoming flocculose towards the margin, and its occur- rence in sandy soils in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests (Jenkins 1988).

Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) exclusively based on morphological study, due to the felted to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal mar- gins, narrowly clavate to subfusiform stipe bases, and the volval remnants on the pileus with long ellipsoid to sub- fusiform  inflated  cells  (Yang  et  al.   2001;   Yang   2005, 2015). It was suggested that this species is very similar to A. hesleri and A. inopinata D. A. Reid & Bas (Yang et al. 2001). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indicates that it is indeed sister to A. hesleri Bas, but that it should  be moved to A. sect.

For comparisons between the two species see the commentary on A. rubiginosa. Most species in A. sect. Roanokenses have white, yellowish to yellow lamellae, while A. avellaneifolia can be easily distin- guished by its biscuit to pale flesh-colored lamellae. Amanita hongoi Bas, described from Japan, is comparable to A. avellaneifolia on account of its similarly colored basidioma. However, A. hongoi has white to yellowish lamellae, a white, dirty white to brownish stipe densely covered with concentrically arranged, minute, concolorous squamules, and clamps are absent in all parts of its basidioma (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2015).\\n']\n",

Chiu (1948) used the name 鈥樷楢. manginiana Har. & Pat.鈥欌 for the collections from Yunnan. However, there are some morphological discrepancies between materials from Yunnan, China and the protologue and type illustration (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Therefore, Yang (1997, 2005, 2015) applied the name A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu to document the Chinese materials.\\nIn our current phylogenetic study (Fig. 1b), A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu and A. manginiana clustered as two distinct monophyletic clades. In addition, A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu can be distinguished from A. manginiana by its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., an apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, a thin, white, limbate volva on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a; this study). Thus, we describe A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu here as a novel species. The name A. caojizong is chosen because it is commonly sold in the mushroom markets of Yunnan Province, China as 鈥樷榗aojizong鈥欌.\\n \\n\\n \\nAccording to our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12), six collections, HKAS 38460 (ITS = AY436463) from Yunnan identified as Amanita manginiana sensu W.\\nF. Chiu by Zhang et al. (2004), FB-30951(CBM) (ITS = AB015702) from Japan identified as A. pseudoporphyria by Oda et al. (2002c), SFC20140823-10 (ITS = KT779083) from the Republic of Korea identified as A. manginiana by Cho et al. (2015), BZ-N11 (ITS = KY747457) from Thailand identified as A. cf. manginiana by Thongbai et al. (2017), and A16 (ITS = FJ441046) and A4 (ITS = FJ441034) submitted to NCBI directly as A. pseudoporphyria, should be A. caojizong.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria Hongo and A. pseudo- manginiana Qing Cai et al. can be confused with A. cao- jizong because of their gray-brown pilei and the limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. pseudo- porphyria differs from A. caojizong by its relatively longer basidiospores   (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.5鈥6.0 lm,   Q = 1.27鈥1.7,  Qm = 1.49 卤 0.13), and the volval remnants on the stipe base have fairly abundant, globose, subglobose to fusiform inflated cells (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita pseudo- manginiana can be distinguished with A. caojizong by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 5 cm in diam., a median annulus, a subglobose basal bulb and fairly abundant, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate inflated cells in the volval remnants on the stipe base.\\nAmanita griseoturcosa Oda et al., A. roseolifolia Yang- Yang Cui et al. and A. modesta Corner & Bas are also similar to A. caojizong in their appearance. However, A. griseoturcosa has a smaller basidioma with pileus 4鈥6 cm in diam. and larger basidiospores (8.4鈥12.0 9 5.6鈥7.6 lm, Q = 1.29鈥1.69, Qm = 1.50 卤 0.13) (Oda et al. 2002a; Cho\\net al. 2015).\\nAmanita roseolifolia has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 4鈥7 cm in diam., dirty white lamellae often with a pinkish tinge and relatively larger basidiospores (9.0鈥11.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm, Q = 1.32鈥1.57, Qm = 1.45 卤\\n0.09).\\nAmanita modesta has a small basidioma with pileus ca. 4鈥6 cm in diam., a subglobose basal bulb, a thick, fleshy volva on the stipe base with abundant inflated cells and subglobose  to  broadly  ellipsoid  basidiospores  (5.5鈥7.5 9 5.0鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.36, Qm = 1.23 卤\\n0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017).\\n']\n",

We have examined the holotype of A. grise- ofarinosa from Japan; this specimen includes four half fruiting bodies, which have small basidiomata with pilei ca. 2鈥5 cm in diam., grayish to pallid pilei densely covered with gray to dark gray, tomentose to pulverulent, some- times subconical volval remnants, grayish and farinose stipes ca. 7 cm long 9 0.5 cm diam., no annulus and no clamps. The basidiospores from holotype were [71/3/1] (8.0鈥) 9.0鈥11.0 (鈥12.0) 9 (6.0鈥) 6.5鈥8.5 (鈥10.0) lm,\\nQ = (1.1鈥) 1.18鈥1.47 (鈥1.54), Qm = 1.29 卤 0.09, broadly\\nellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. griseofarinosa is closely related to A. cinereovelata Hosen. However, A. cinereovelata differs from A. griseofarinosa in the presence of clamps and in its associations with Shorea robusta trees (Hosen et al. 2015).\\nAmanita griseofarinosa can be easily confused with A. berkeleyi (Hooker f. in Berk.) due to their shared brownish gray basidiomata covered with pulverulent volval remnants over the entire surface of pilus and stipe, and the absence of clamps, but A. berkeleyi differs from A. griseofarinosa by its distinctly larger basidioma and felted-pulverulent, crust- like volval remnants on the pileus often breaking into minute, polygonal patches (Bas 1969). Yang (2015) reported A. berkeleyi from China based on a morphological\\n \\n\\n \\nstudy of the collection HKAS 83447. However, the col- lection is nested in the clade of A. griseofarinosa in the present study (Fig. 2). Thus, we treated this material as A. griseofarinosa.\\n']\n",

Yang 6079 (HKAS 101268).\\nCommentary: The concept of A. manginiana Har. & Pat., a species described by Hariot and Patouillard (1914) from Vietnam, was unclear, because the type is not in good condition for either phylogenetic or morphological study (Gilbert 1941a; Yang 1997). Fortunately, we have col- lected a specimen (HKAS 101268) similar to A. mangini- ana from Vietnam, which has been included in our study. Our current multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) indicates that the Vietnamese specimen (HKAS 101268) clusters within the monophyletic Chinese clade with 100% statistical support. In addition, the morphological charac- ters of specimens are consistent with the protologue and type illustration of A. manginiana, except for the absence of the yellowish pileal margin (Hariot and Patouillard 1914; Gilbert 1941a). Consequently, we treat specimens in this clade as A. manginiana for the present.\\nAmanita manginiana is characterized by its relatively small basidioma with a pileus ca. 5鈥8 cm in diam., a median, thick, persistent annulus, a thick, gray, limbate volva on the stipe base with the inner part composed of abundant to nearly dominant, globose, subglobose, ellip- soid to clavate inflated cells, and ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.7鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.38鈥1.6, Qm = 1.49 卤\\n0.01).\\nAmanita manginiana is similar to A. caojizong, which was treated as A. manginiana sensu W. F. Chiu in Yang\\n \\n(1997, 2005, 2015) and described as a novel species in this study. However, A. caojizong differs from A. manginiana in its relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 (鈥20) cm in diam., the apical to subapical, large, fragile annulus, thin, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base composed with scarce, ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose inflated cells.\\nAmanita pseudomanginiana can be confused with A. manginiana in that they share medium-sized basidiomata with gray-brown to brown pilei, median annuli, limbate volval remnants on the stipe base and mostly ellipsoid basidiospores. However, A. pseudomanginiana differs from\\nA. manginiana in its relatively slender basidioma, a thin annulus attached on the middle part of stipe surface, white limbate volval remnants on the stipe base with fairly abundant to abundant inflated cells, which are mostly ellipsoid, elongate to clavate, rarely subglobose.\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria is similar to A. manginiana, but the former has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 5鈥15 cm in diam., an apical, large, fragile annulus, and a thin, white volva on the stipe base with fairly abundant inflated cells (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; see below).\\nAmanita modesta, A. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia are also comparable to A. manginiana in their gray pilei and limbate volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. modesta has a large, apical annulus, a white volva on the stipe  base  and  relatively   smaller   basidiospores  (5.5鈥7.5  9 5.0鈥6.0 lm,     Q  = 1.1鈥1.36,    Qm  =  1.23 卤\\n0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015; Lee 2017).

It is found in tropical forests.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), HKAS 100504 and HKAS 101425 split into two subclades based on PTP analysis. Since only subtle morphological and ecological differences were found to separate them, we treat them as a single species, A.minutisquama. No closely related species of A. minutisquama were uncovered in our current study (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita virginea Massee and A. virgineoides are similar to A. minutisquama in their white basidiomata, conical volval remnants often arranged in incomplete belts on stipe base, and the presence of clamps. However, A. virginea has relatively larger conical volval remnants on the pileus (up to 4 mm in height and 3 mm in width), a more globose basal bulb at the stipe base, and broader basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.3) (Corner and  Bas\\n1962; Bas 1969; Lee 2017). Amanita virgineoides has an ovoid to fusiform stipe base, a large, apical annulus with a verrucose lower surface, and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Yang 1997, 2000,\\n2005, 2015; see below).\\n \\nAmanita brunneostrobilipes, a novel species described in this study, can be confused with A. minutisquama because of their shared white basidiomata and similar habitats.

This species has been traditionally put into A. sect. Amidella based on morphological data (Hongo 1982; Tulloss et al. 1992a; Yang 2005, 2015). However, our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b)  indicates   that   it   actually   belongs   in   A. sect. Roanokenses and is related to A. pseudomanginiana,\\nA. pseudoporphyria and A. atrobrunnea Thongbai et al.\\nIndeed, its inflated stipe base and limbate volva suggest that it is a member of A. sect. Roanokenses. However, the latter three species have a dark brown, gray-brown to gray pileus and white to whitish limbate volval remnants on the stipe base (Hongo 1957; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; Li et al. 2016). In addition, A. pseudomanginiana has a relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 5 cm in diam, while A. atrobrunnea has a broad umbo on the pileal center and a pileipellis composed of radically arranged filamentous hyphae with inflated termi- nal cells (Li et al. 2016).

Indeed, they are also similar in morphological appearance. However, A. heishidingensis has relatively larger verrucae (ca. 1鈥6 mm in height and 1鈥6 mm in width) on the pileus, cream lamellae lacking a greenish tinge and relatively larger basidiospores (8.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Li and Cai\\n2014; Yang 2015).\\nThe grayish to gray basidioma, the verrucae on the pileus and the non-radicating basal bulb of A. palli- dochlorotica are also reminiscent of A. japonica and A. griseoverrucosa Zhu L. Yang. However, A. japonica dif- fers from A. pallidochlorotica in that its lamellae lack a greenish tinge and it has a fusiform basal bulb (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014). Amanita griseoverrucosa, a species previously in A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969), but transferred to A. sect. Strobiliformes in this study, differs from A. pallidochlorotica in its white lamellae lacking a greenish tinge, relatively larger basid- iospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) and the absence of\\nclamps (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015).\\nThe European species A. solitaria (Bull.: Fr.) Fr. is also comparable to A. pallidochlorotica in the greenish lamel- lae. However, A. solitaria can be easily distinguished by its distinctly larger basidiospores (9.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm)\\n(Gilbert 1940; Bas 1969; Contu 2000a; Yang 2015).\\nOther species in A. sect. Roanokenses that are compa- rable to A. pallidochlorotica, in that they share a gray pileus with volval remnants on its surface often appearing as conical to warted particles, are A. griseofarinosa and A. vestita. However, A. griseofarinosa has white lamellae, a clavate to ventricose basal bulb with the upper part covered with floccose to pulverulent volval remnants, broader basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) and no clamps (Bas  1969;  Imazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Yang   1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Imazeki et al. 2011).

Phylogenetically, A. parvivirginea clustered as a distinct lineage with high divergence from other groups (Fig. 1b). Morphologically, A. parvivirginea is similar to A. vir- gineoides and A. virginea. However, these two species share significantly larger basidiomata and the presence of clamps (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969;\\nYang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Lee 2017). Furthermore, A.\\nvirgineoides has larger basidiospores (8鈥10 9 6鈥7.5 lm)\\n(Bas 1969; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015).\\nAmanita parvivirginea can be confused with A. polypyramis (Berk. & M. A. Curtis) Sacc., but the latter has larger basidioma with a pileus 7.5鈥15 cm in diam., smaller conical warts on the pileus, longer basidiospores (10.0鈥13.0 9 6.5鈥8.0 lm) and the absence of clamps (Bas 1969; Morales-Torres et al. 1999).\\nAmanita squarrosa Nagas. & Hongo, described from Japan, is also comparable to A. parvivirginea. However, A. squarrosa differs from A. parvivirginea by its larger basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 7.0鈥9.0 lm) and the presence of clamps (Nagasawa and Hongo 1984).\\n']\n",

In China, A. roseolifolia was misidentified as A. griseoturcosa by Yang (2015). However, these two species can be separated both by phylogenetic and morphological evidence. Our ITS phy- logenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that the holotype of\\nA. griseoturcosa and A. roseolifolia fell into two distinct clades. In addition, A. griseotucosa can be morphologically distinguished from A. roseolifolia by its gray pileus with a turquoise tinge, white lamellae and a limbate volva often appressed to stipe (Oda et al. 2002c; Cho et al. 2015).\\nAmanita pseudoporphyria and A. caojizong are similar to A. roseolifolia in appearance. However, the former two species have relatively larger basidiomata with pilei ca. 5鈥15 cm in diam., white lamellae lacking a pinkish tinge and      relatively      smaller      basidiospores      (7.0鈥9.0 9\\n4.5鈥6.0 lm,   Q = 1.27鈥1.7,   Qm = 1.49 卤 0.13   for   A.\\npseudoporphyria; 6.0鈥8.0 9 4.5鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.16鈥1.57, Qm = 1.37 卤 0.09   for   A.   caojizong)   (Hongo   1957;\\n \\n\\n \\nImazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang 1997, 2000, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang et al. 2001; Imazeki et al. 2011; this study).\\nAmanita modesta is also somewhat similar to A. rose- olifolia in its gray pileus with innate fibrils. However, A. modesta has white lamellae, a fleshy and limbate volva with abundant inflated cells, and globose to broadly ellip- soid basidiospores (5.5鈥7.5 9 5.0鈥6.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.36,\\nQm = 1.23 卤 0.07) (Corner and Bas 1962; Yang 2015;\\nLee 2017).\\nAmanita pseudomanginiana and A. manginiana are also comparable to A. roseolifolia in that they share gray pilei and limbate volval remnants on the stipe base.

Yang 5734 [HKAS 80014,\\nidentified as Amanita griseoverrucosa in Yang (2015)].\\nCommentary: Amanita aspericeps is characterized by its medium-sized to large basidioma, a dirty white, grayish to gray pileus covered with gray verrucae that are often white to whitish in their apical part, a subapical annulus, a ven- tricose stipe base with its lower part slightly radicating, broadly ellipsoid, ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (8.0鈥11.0 9 5.0鈥7.0 lm), the absence of clamps and its occurrence in subtropical forests dominated by Fagaceae, occasionally mixed with Pinaceae.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), the spec- imens putatively assigned to a new species split into two subclades (HKAS 77783-HKAS 101391-HKAS 78435\\nsubclade and HKAS 80014-HKAS 100519 subclade) and were recognized as two phylogenetic species based on both GCPSR and PTP analyses. However, no obvious morpho- logical and ecological differences were observed between species in these clades, according to our current study. Consequently, we treat them here as a single species, described here under the name A. aspericeps.\\nAmanita aspericeps is phylogenetically sister and mor- phologically similar to A. cinereoradicata Yang-Yang Cui et al. (Fig. 1b). However, the latter differs from A. aspericeps in its larger basidioma and longer basidiospores (9.5鈥11.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) (Yuan and Sun 1995; Yang\\n1997, 2005, 2015; see below). Furthermore, A. cinereo- radicata is dominant in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Abies or Picea  (Yuan  and  Sun  1995;  Yang  1997, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nAmanita griseoverrucosa is very similar to A. aspericeps in appearance. However, A. griseoverrucosa has a paler (dirty  white)  pileus  and  an  apical  annulus  (Yang   2004, 2005, 2015; see below).\\nSpecies in A. sect. Roanokenses that share a gray pileus and are comparable to A. aspericeps include A. griseofari- nosa, A. berkeleyi, A. vestita, A. pallidochlorotica and A. cinereoconia G. F. Atk. However, A. griseofarinosa has tomentose, floccose to pulverulent volval remnants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements, a stipe\\n \\ndensely covered with tomentose to pulverulent squamules and    relatively    broader    basidiospores    (8.0鈥10.0  9\\n6.0鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Yang\\n1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Imazeki et al. 2011). Amanita berkeleyi has a relatively larger basidioma with a pileus ca. 12.5鈥17.5 cm in diam., crust-like volval remnants on the pileus sometimes breaking into minute, polygonal patches, and relatively broader basidiospores (8鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990). Amanita vestita has a relatively smaller basidioma with a pileus ca. 3鈥5 cm in diam., and brownish volval remnants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita palli- dochlorotica can be distinguished from A. aspericeps by its cream lamellae with a greenish tinge, smaller basidiospores (7.0鈥9.0 9 4.5鈥6.0 lm) and the presence of clamps. Amanita cinereoconia, a species described from the USA, has a relatively smaller basidioma with a pileus ca. 3鈥7 cm in diam. and narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥10.9 9 4.7鈥6.2 lm)\\n(Coker   1917;  Gilbert   1940,   1941a;  Bas  1969; Jenkins\\n1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\n']\n",

It is predominantly associated with broad- leaved trees.\\nOur ITS phylogenetic study (Fig. S14) showed that A. brunneolimbata was closely related to the North American\\nA. brunnescens G. F. Atk. Indeed, these two species are morphologically similar to each other in their reddish often longitudinally splitting basal bulb with a short limbate or collar-like, dirty white to brownish to brown volva. How- ever, A. brunnescens has a relatively robuster basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus often covered with white to pale ocheraceous, floccose patches and is associated with mixed forests (Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita citrina var. grisea (Hongo) Hongo can be confused with A. brunneolimbata because of the similar colors of their basidiomata. However, our phylogenetic data (Fig. S14) indicate that they represent two distinct species, and A. citrina var. grisea differs from A. brun- neolimbata by its non-umbonate pileus, yellow volval remnants on the pileus, and  yellow  annulus  (Hongo  1958, 1959; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; this study). HKAS 79025, treated as A. citrina var. grisea in Yang (2015), is clearly A. brunneolimbata according on our data.\\n']\n",

It is noteworthy that the color of A. citrinoannulata is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, brown, grayish brown to dark brown.\\nPhylogenetically, A. citrinoannulata is closely related and morphologically similar to the European species A. spissa (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Fig. 1b). However, A. spissa differs from A. citrinoannulata in its robust basidioma, a gray pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking snakeskin-like, yellow squamules, white to dirty white volval remnants on the stipe base and a white annulus (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015). Furthermore, the reddish discoloration following bruising of A. spissa only occurs on the stipe surface, while in A. citrinoannulata the discoloration can occur over all\\n \\n\\n \\nparts of the basidioma (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J.\\nE. Lange and A. flavorubens (Berk. & Mont.) Sacc. are morphologically similar to A. citrinoannulata in that they share basidiomata with red discoloration on bruising, and yellow annuli. However, A. rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J. E. Lange has a grayish brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking yel- low, snakeskin-like squamules, and an inflated basal bulb glabrous or covered with dirty white, grayish to brown volval remnants (Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita flavorubens has a brown to yellow pileus covered with patchy, lemon yellow volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores (9.4鈥10.2 9 6.2鈥7.0 lm) (Atkinson 1902; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAdditional species in A. sect. Validae sharing basid- iomata with more or less red discoloration when bruised include A. orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N. Lakh., A. rubescens Pers. and A. excelsa (Fr.: Fr.) Bertillon. However, A. orsonii and A. rubescens have a brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a dirty white to grayish stipe lacking yellow squamules above the annulus, and a white annulus often with a reddish tinge (Gilbert 1940; Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss et al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa, a species described from Sweden, has a robust basidioma with a red tinge only occurring at the stipe base, a white stipe lacking yellow squamules, and a white to dirty white annulus (Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Poumarat 2004).\\nBasidiomata of A. citrinoannulata with a gray-brown to gray pileus are also comparable to those of A. fritillaria Sacc. and A. spissacea S. Imai. However, the basidiomata of the latter two species do not change color when injured (Imai  1933,  1938;  Hongo  1959;  Corner  and  Bas  1962;\\nImazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988,  2011;\\nKumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015). Furthermore, A. fritillaria has a white to dirty white stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, a basal bulb covered with conical, verrucose to floccose, blackish, dark gray to gray- brown volval remnants and a dirty white to gray annulus (Corner and Bas 1962; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang  2005, 2015; this study). Amanita spissacea possesses a dirty white to gray stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, pulverulent to floccose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants on the stipe base, a grayish annulus and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Imazeki and\\nHongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; this study).\\n \\n']\n",

Atk., a species described from the USA (Fig. 1b). However, A. flavoconia has an orange-yellow basidioma, a yellow annulus and narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥8.6 9 5.5鈥6.2 lm) (Jenkins 1982, 1986; Thiers 1982; Atkinson 1902; Tulloss et al. 1995; Tullos 2000b).\\nAmanita  detersa  is  very  similar  to  A. flavosquamosa\\nYang-Yang Cui et al., a novel species described in this\\n \\n\\n \\nstudy, and comparisons between the two taxa are summa- rized in the commentary on A. flavosquamosa.\\nThe yellow volval remnants of A. detersa are similar to those of the European A. franchetii (Boud.)

(2004), clustered within A. flavosquamosa with strong support (MLB = 100%). Therefore, we assign HKAS 38419 to A. flavosquamosa. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. flavosquamosa (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can be confused with A. detersa because of the color and form of the basidiomata, and the volval remnants on the pileus.

JAPAN. HOKKAIDO: Nopporo, altitude unknown, 10 October 1926, S. Imai (TYPE).\\nCommentary: Imai (1933) described A. sepiacea from Japan without assignment of a type. Hongo (1959) desig- nated a type for the species; it was collected by S. Imai from Nopporo, Hokkaido on 10 October 1926. We exam- ined the type and found that most basidiospores had col- lapsed, and only a few basidiospores could be measured. They were [15/1/1] 7.5鈥9.5 (鈥10.5)  9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥7.2 (鈥7.5)\\nlm,   Q = (1.1鈥)   1.14鈥1.4   (鈥1.45),   Qm = 1.27 卤 0.1,\\nbroadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled A. sepiacea were supported as two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Since morphological differences between them were only subtle, we consider them to be a single species, A. sepiacea. No closely related species of A. sepiacea were detected in our current study (Fig. 1b). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A.  sepiacea  see  Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

FRIESLAND PRO-\\nVINCE: Vlieland, in planted pine forests on coastal dunes, 23 October 1994, C. Bas 8942 (L).\\nCommentary: Amanita concentrica was described from Japan by Oda et al. (2002b). It was then reported from China, India and Thailand (Yang 2005, 2015; Semwal et al. 2007; Thongbai et al. 2016).\\nIn our multi-locus data (Fig. 1b), A. concentrica clus- tered, with low support, with the A. muscaria group, which consists of A. gemmata (Fr.) Bertillon, A. muscaria (L.) Lam., A. regalis (Fr.) Michael, A. persicina (Dav.T. Jenkins) Tulloss & Geml., A. ibotengutake T. Oda, C. Tanaka & Tsuda and A. flavopantherina Yang-Yang Cui  et al. However, the two specimens of A. gemmata from the Netherlands listed above differ from A. concentrica by their grayish yellow to yellowish pilei, volval remnants on the pileus dominantly composed of subradically arranged elements with very abundant to nearly dominant filamen- tous hyphae, volval remnants on the stipe base limbate, basidiospores   [120/6/2]   (9鈥)   9.5鈥12.0   (鈥13.0) 9 (6.0鈥)\\n6.5鈥8.5 (鈥9.0) lm, Q = (1.17鈥) 1.25鈥1.62 (鈥1.77), Qm =\\n1.42 卤 0.13, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and the absence of clamps.\\nThe other species in this group differ morphologically from A. concentrica in the following ways. Amanita\\n \\n\\n \\nmuscaria has a red pileus and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores  (9.0鈥12.5 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm)  (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang and Oberwinkler 1999; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser  2000; Galli 2001; Neville  and\\nPoumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015).

Amanita persicina has a pastel red to light orange or melon-colored pileus covered with yellowish to tannish, floccose-fibrillose patches, cream lamellae with a pinkish tint, the context of the stipe turns yellowish when cut or bruised and the basidiospores are relatively longer (9.4鈥12.7 9 7.0鈥8.5 lm) (Jenkins\\n1977, 1986; Tulloss et al. 2015).

The descriptions above were based on the Chinese materials cited here. We also studied four collections from the USA as listed in specimens examined, and the basid- iospores of these specimens were [80/4/4] 6.5鈥8.0 (鈥 10) 9 (5.0鈥) 5.5鈥7.0 (鈥8.0) lm, Q = (1.05鈥) 1.12鈥1.34 (鈥\\n1.4), Qm = 1.22 卤 0.08, often subglobose to broadly ellipsoid, or rarely ellipsoid.\\nOur phylogenetic data (Figs. 1b, S6) indicate that col- lections of A. farinosa from China and the USA form a monophyletic clade within A. sect. Amanita. Since no significant morphological differences were found between the Chinese collections and those from the USA, we treat the Chinese Amanita as A. farinosa.

It is dominant in subalpine forests with Picea and Abies.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b), A. griseopantherina is related to A. subglobosa, A. pan- therina, A. pseudopantherina Zhu L. Yang et al. and A. velatipes G. F. Atk. However, A. subglobosa, a species described form southwestern China and also similar to A. griseopantherina in appearance, has a relatively smaller basidioma, and is found in forests dominated by Pinaceae and Fagaceae at relatively lower altitudes (Yang  1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita pantherina, a species descri- bed from Europe but not found in China, has a relatively lower annulus, narrower basidiospores and no clamps (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Yang 1997; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita pseudopantherina, a provisional name proposed by Yang (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015) and formally described as a novel species in this study, differs from A. griseopantherina by its relatively pale (brown to yellow-brown) pileus and the absence of clamps. Amanita velatipes, described from North America, can be easily distinguished from A. griseopantherina by its paler pileus covered with white patches, and smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b;\\nJenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita griseopantherina can be easily confused with\\nA.\\tflavopantherina in their similar appearance and habitats. However,  A.  flavopantherina  has  a  darker  brown pileus\\n \\n\\n \\ncovered with yellow volval remnants, a white to yellow context, a relatively lower and yellower annulus with an obviously brown edge, a browner stipe, and broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (10鈥12 9 8鈥10 lm).\\nAmanita pakistanica is similar to A. griseopantherina in the presence of clamps and Abies hosts. However, A. pakistanica has an umbonate pileus covered with patchy or flaky, detersile volval remnants and relatively narrower basidiospores (10.1鈥12.2 9 7鈥8.8 lm) (Tulloss et al. 2001). In our phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS data (Fig. S6) they represent two distinct species.\\nAmanita ibotengutake, a species described from Japan and also distributed in northeastern China, is also similar to\\nA. griseopantherina in their brown pileus and the common presence of clamps. However, A. ibotengutake has a rela- tively smaller and slender basidioma, and narrower basid- iospores (8鈥10 9 6鈥7.5 lm) (Oda et al. 2002c; Yang 2015; see below).\\n']\n",

In our ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S6), A. pseu- dopantherina was closely related to A. pantherina. How- ever, the European A. pantherina has a robust basidioma, and narrower basidiospores (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville\\nand Poumarat 2004; this study).\\nIn China, species in Amanita sect. Amanita with brown pileus covered with white, pyramidal, verrucose, conical volval remnants, and shortly limbate volval remnants on the stipe base comparable to A. pseudopantherina include\\nA.\\tparvipantherina, A. subglobosa, and A. subparvipan- therina Zhu L. Yang et al. However, A. parvipantherina has a relatively smaller and slender basidioma, and rela- tively narrower basidiospores (8.5鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm) (Yang et al. 2004; Yang 2005, 2015). Amanita subglobosa can be distinguished from A. pseudopantherina by its rel- atively darker colored pileus and the common presence of clamps (Yang 1997, 2005, 2015). Amanita subparvipan- therina possesses narrower basidiospores (9.0鈥11.5 9 6.5鈥8.0 lm) and more abundant inflated cells in the volval remnants on the pileus (Ariyawansa et al. 2015; see below).\\nThe North American A. velatipes is somewhat similar to\\nA. pseudopantherina, but the former has a paler yellow pileus covered with warted to patchy volval remnants, and relatively smaller basidiospores (7.9鈥9.4 9 5.5鈥6.3 lm) (Murrill 1913; Gilbert 1941b; Jenkins 1977, 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\n']\n",

However, the latter can be distinguished by its orange to orange-yellow umbonate pileus, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.25鈥0.35 R) and an orange-yellow annulus.\\nAmanita fuscoflava is also macroscopically similar to A. similis Boedijn, A. malayensis Tang et al. and A. aporema Boedijn. However, A. similis has a yellow stipe covered with pinkish orange squamules and a pinkish orange to grayish annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Amanita malayensis has a yellow pileus with its center often yellowish orange, maize yellow or saffron yellow, shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.3鈥0.4 R), whitish lamellae, and slightly larger basid- iospores (9.0鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Tang et al. 2018). Amanita aporema has a non-umbonate and slightly depressed pileal center, whitish to cream lamellae, a dirty white to cream stipe, a whitish to cream annulus and glo- bose basidiospores (9.5鈥11.0 9 8.5鈥10.5 lm) (Boedijn\\n1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita chatamagotake N. Endo & A. Yamada and A. hayalyuy D. Arora & G. H. Shepard are comparable to A. fuscoflava. However, A. chatamagotake has relatively shorter striations on the pileal  margin (0.2鈥0.5 R)  (Endo et al. 2017). Furthermore, A. chatamagotake exhibits a variable pileus color. Typically, A. chatamagotake has a pileus that is grayish to olive brown, which is darker than that of A. fuscoflava (Endo et al. 2017). Amanita hayalyuy has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 8鈥18 cm, shorter striations on the pileal margin, and a yellow stipe decorated with orangey brown squamules (Shepard et al. 2008).\\n']\n",

Yang (2015) then recorded the collection of HKAS 43098 as A. incarnatifolia. In this study, we follow Yang鈥檚 treatment and consider the monophyletic clade, which contains the collection of HKAS 43098, as A. incarnatifolia.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita incarnatifolia is phylogenetically related and morphologically similar to A. longistriata S. Imai, A. ris- tichii Tulloss, A. virginiana (Murrill) Sacc. & Trotter and\\nA. cf. incarnatifolia (Fig. 1b). However, A. longistriata has relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, relatively wider        basidiospores         (10.0鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥11.0 lm, Q = (1.22鈥) 1.11鈥1.3, Qm = 1.21 卤 0.08) and is dominant in pine forests (Imai 1938; Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Hongo 1959; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita ristichii has a white basidioma (Tulloss 1989). Amanita virginiana a darker (fuliginous to dark brown) pileus, relatively longer striations on the pileus margin, white to off-white lamellae and relatively wider basid- iospores (12.5鈥13.3 9 9.4鈥11.7 lm, Q = 1.11鈥1.45) (Jenkins 1979; Tulloss 1993). Because morphological dif- ferences between A. longistriata and A. cf. incarnatifolia (specimens examined listed under A. longistriata) are subtle, more collections are necessary before a formal description of A. cf. incarnatifolia is made.

In  our  phylogenetic  analysis (Fig. 1b), samples of A. hemibapha var. ochracea Zhu L. Yang and A. hemibapha var. hemibapha cluster in distinct clades. Amanita hemibapha var. ochracea differs from A. hemibapha var. hemibapha by its larger and more robust basidioma with a brown umbonate pileus, and its subalpine distribution. Consequently, we treated A. hemibapha var. ochracea as a novel species, A. ochracea.\\nIn our phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1b, S7), three col- lections, RET 317-5 in the multi-locus data, RET 718-7 (ITS = KX810029) and RET 290-5 (ITS = JX 844699) in\\nthe ITS data, which were submitted to NCBI as a provi- sional name of A. cinnamomescens Tulloss et al., clustered together in the monophyletic A ochracea clade. Further- more, the morphological and ecological differences between these three species and A. ochracea are only subtle and they should therefore be considered A. ochra- cea. In addition, one specimen, DAK-M-08 (ITS = KC797155), which was submitted to NCBI under the name\\nA. calyptroderma G. F. Atk. & V. G. Ballen, also clustered within the clade of A.  ochracea  in  our  ITS  analysis  (Fig. S7) and should be A. ochracea.\\nAmanita ochracea is phylogenetically (Figs. 1b, S7) related to A. vernicoccora Bojantchev & R. M. Davis. However, A. vernicoccora, described from the USA, has a relatively smaller basidioma, a yellow pileus covered with a monolithic patch at the center, and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores (9.2鈥11.8 9 6.2鈥7.1 lm) (Bojantchev et al.\\n2011).\\nAmanita ochracea is also somewhat similar to A. javanica and A. rubromarginata in its macroscopic appearance. However, the latter two species have a\\n \\nrelatively smaller basidioma, an orange-red to red pileus that is 5鈥13 cm in diameter, yellow lamellae with reddish to orange-red lamellar edges and a reddish to orange-red annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Takahashi 2004; Imazeki et al. 2011; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018). Amanita ochracea is also comparable to the North Amer- ican A. arkansana H. R. Rosen, but the latter has relatively longer striations on the pileal margin (0.4鈥0.5 R) and smaller basidiospores (7.5鈥10.0 9 7.0鈥8.0 lm) (Rosen\\n1926; Gilbert 1941a; Jenkins 1986).\\n']\n",

Thus, these three specimens should be A. pseudoprinceps.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) indi- cated that A. pseudoprinceps was sister to A. aporema Boedijn. Based on the original description and the exami- nations of collections, A. aporema differs from A. pseu- doprinceps by its relatively smaller basidioma with pileus ca. 6鈥10 cm in diam., and a relatively darker colored pileus (red-brown) with relatively longer striations (ca. 0.5 R) (Boedijn 1951; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita pseudoprinceps can be confused with A. prin- ceps as they share a yellow-brown pileus with short stria- tions (0.2鈥0.3 R).

Yang (2005) cited four specimens under the name A. similis, which were morphologically similar to\\nA. similis, but no DNA sequences were generated from the collections. In this study, we continue to treat these four Chinese specimens as A. similis.\\nOur multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 1b) indicate that\\nA. similis is related to A. subhemibapha and A. fuscoflava. However, A. subhemibapha has a yellow to yellowish pileus with its center orange and relatively shorter stria- tions (0.25鈥0.35 R) on the pileal margin. Amanita fus- coflava has a yellow stipe decorated with yellow squamules and a yellow annulus.\\nMorphologically, A. similis is similar to A. malayensis Tang et al., A. princeps Corner and Bas and A. aporema Boedijn. However, these species differ from A. similis in the following ways. A. malayensis has a yellow pileus with its center yellowish orange, maize yellow or saffron yel- low, relatively shorter striations (0.3鈥0.4 R) on the pileal margin, a yellow stipe decorated with yellow scales, and a yellowish white to whitish annulus (Tang et al. 2018). Amanita princeps has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 10鈥20 cm, relatively shorter striations on the pileal margin (0.25鈥0.3 R), a white stipe, a white annulus, a\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFig. 13  Microscopic features of Amanita squarrosipes (TYPE, HKAS 76359). a Hymenium and subhymenium; b basidiospores.

Endo & A. Yamada and A. hayalyuy D. Arora & G. H. Shepard are comparable to A. similis. However, A. chatamagotake has a yellow or grayish yellow stipe without orange scales, a yellow annulus and relatively shorter striations (0.2鈥0.5 R) on the pileal margin (Endo et al. 2017). Amanita hayalyuy has a relatively larger basidioma with pileus ca. 8鈥18 cm, a relatively brighter colored pileus (golden-brown or bright yellow-brown), relatively shorter striations on pileal mar- gin, a yellowish annulus and relatively larger basidiospores (9.3鈥11.7 9 6.2鈥7.8 lm) (Shepard et al. 2008).\\n']\n",

Amanita javanica and A. rubromarginata have a redder pileus with relatively longer striations on the pileal margin (ca. 0.5 R), yellow lamellae with reddish to orange-red lamellar edges and a reddish to orange-red annulus (Boedijn 1951; Corner and Bas 1962; Takahashi 2004; Imazeki et al. 2011; Lee 2017; Tang et al. 2018; this study).\\nAmanita rubroflava Yang-Yang Cui, Qing Cai & Zhu L. Yang, A. caesarea and A. caesareoides are also similar to\\nA.\\tsubhemibapha in appearance. However, A. rubroflava, a novel species described in this study, differs from A. sub- hemibapha in its distinctly umbonate pileus and slightly broader basidiospores (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm). The European A. caesarea has a robuster basidioma with a shorter stipe, a redder pileus with shorter striations on its margin and larger basidiospores (8.5鈥12.0 9 6.0鈥8.0 lm) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Wasser 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study). Amanita caesareoides has a redder umbonate pileus, and is dominant in temperate East Asia (Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988; Cho et al. 2015; Yang 2015; Endo et al. 2016).\\n']\n",

Indeed, A. griseoumbonata is morphologically similar to A. shennongjiana and they share a slender basidioma with an umbonate pileus, globose to subglobose basidiospores and a similar structure of the volval remnants on the stipe base. However, A. griseoumbonata differs from A. shennongjiana by its darker-colored pileus and is found in coniferous or mixed forests.\\nThe European A. vaginata var. vaginata is similar to A. shennongjiana in appearance, but A. vaginata var. vaginata has a robust basidioma, a non-umbonate pileus with rela- tively shorter striations on the margin and a relatively thicker volva on the stipe base (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Contu 2000a, b; Consiglio 2000; Massart 2000; Galli 2001; this study).\\nAmanita ovalispora and A. pseudovaginata are some- what similar to A. shennongjiana. However, A. ovalispora has a robuster basidioma, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (8.5鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥7.5 lm), a more robust volva on the stipe base, and occurs in more southern regions (Boedijn 1951; this study). Amanita pseudovagi- nata possesses a relatively paler-colored pileus and sub- globose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (10.5鈥13.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) (Hongo 1983; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang\\nand Doi 1999).\\n \\n']\n",

However, collections of A. volvata listed under A. brunneomaculata have basidioma with an obvious reddish brown color change when bruised or injured, and is documented as being found in mixed forests in North American (Bas 1969; Jenkins 1978, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995; this study).

On sandy soil, only known in south-western and western Australia and puta- tively associated with ectomycorhizal partners of Euca- lyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton.\\nCommentary: Previous data and our multi-locus phylo- genetic study indicate that eight sequestrate species are currently  known  in  Amanita  (Malenc赂on  1955;  Miller  and\\n \\nHorak 1992; Bougher 1999; Bougher and Lebel 2002; Hallen et al. 2004; Justo et al. 2010; Truong et al. 2017). Of these, A. arenaria was described as belonging to Torrendia and was then transferred to Amanita by Justo et al. (2010). It clustered with two agaricoid species, A. lesueurii E.\\nM. Davison and A. wadjukiorum E. M. Davison, originally described from Western Australia and assigned to the stirps Strobiliformis of A. sect.  Lepidella  sensu  Bas  (Davison et al. 2013), as a distinct clade with strong statistic support. Furthermore, species in this clade are characterized by their agaricoid or sequestrate basidiomata, smooth basid- iospores; the absence of clamps and their distributions in south-western and western Australia in association with Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Corymbia, Acacia, Daviesia, Eremophila, Melaleuca and Brachychiton. We therefore treated this clade as a novel section.\\nOur multigene-phylogenetic data (Fig. 1a) strongly indicate that A. sect. Arenariae shares a common ancestor with A. sect. Phalloideae, sect. Validae and sect. Strobili- formes. Fungi from these sections usually have amyloid basidiospores. However, this is not the case for the species\\nA.\\tarenaria. Justo et al. (2010) suggested that A. arenaria probably evolved from an amyloid-spored ancestor but this character was lost during the gasteromycetation process. To date, no species of A. sect. Arenariae has been reported from China.\\nAmanita  sect.  Phalloideae  (Fr.)  Que麓l.,  Me麓m.  Soc.  Emul. Montbe麓liard, Ser.

Phal- loideae could be separated into three subclades with high support (lethal Amanita subclade, A. hesleri-A. zangii subclade, and A. pseudogemmata-A. ballerina subclade), which may be treated as separate subsections. However, we will not formally propose such taxonomic changes until more  taxa  are  studied.  To  date,  15  species   of   A.  sect.

The fatalities caused by lethal Amanita species are presented in Fig. 35. Species in this subclade are characterized by a non-striate pileus rarely covered membranous volval remnants, attenuate lamellulae, a basal bulb with a limbate volva and the absence of clamps. To date, 12 lethal Amanita species have been found in China (see below).\\nOnly two species, A. hesleri and A. zangii, were rec- ognized from the Amanita hesleri Bas subclade, and both were previously assigned to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969). Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both should be in A. sect. Phalloideae (Cai et al. 2014; Figs. 1b, S11), although neither amatoxins nor phallotoxins were detected in the basidiomata of A. zangii (Cai et al. 2014). Species in this subclade are characterized by their subconical to flat verrucose, felty to subfibrillose volval remnants on the pileus, appendiculate pileal margins, slenderly clavate to subfusiform base covered with floccose or warted volval remnants and the absence of clamps. To date, only A. zangii has been found in China (see below). Currently, four species are known from the A. pseudo- gemmata subclade: A. pseudogemmata Hongo, A. levistri- ata D. T. Jenkins, A. ballerina Raspe麓 et al. and A. franzii Zhu L. Yang et al. (Figs. 1b, S11). Species in this subclade are characterized by their striate pileal margins, truncate to nearly truncate lamellulae, marginate to sublimbate bulbs, (weakly) amyloid basidiospores and the absence of clamps. Amatoxins or phallotoxins have not been detected in A. pseudogemmata, A. ballerina and A. franzii (Cai et al.\\n \\n2014; Thongbai et al. 2017).

However, A. ballerina can be distinguished from A. franzii by its relatively smaller basidioma and a white pileus covered with white to cream patchy volval remnants (Thongbai et al. 2017).\\nAmanita pseudogemmata is comparable to A. franzii in the marginate basal bulb. However, A. pseudogemmata differs from A. franzii by its yellow pileus covered with yellow to yellow-brown volval remnants, and a yellow stipe with its basal bulb covered with collar-like, white to yellowish volval remnants (Hongo 1974b; Yang and Doi 1999; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\nThe marginate bulb of Amanita franzii and the nature of the volval remnants are reminiscent of species of A. sub- sect. Limbatulae, including A. mutabilis Beardslee, A. parva (Murrill) Murrill, and A. praelongispora (Murrill) Murrill, which were described from the USA.

This  species  is  deadly  poisonous (Kawase et al. 1992; Imazeki et al. 1988; Chen et al. 2016; Tang     et al. 2016). The albino form of A. subjunquillea was treated  as  A.  subjunquillea   var.   alba   by   Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015). Since few genetic differences between the albino form and the non-albino form are present, we treat A. subjunquillea var. alba as a synonym of A. sub- junquillea var. subjunquillea (Cai et al. 2014).\\n \\nPhylogenetically, A. subjunquillea is closely related to\\nA. phalloides (Vaill.:Fr.) Link (Fig. 1b). Indeed, they are also morphologically similar to each other. However, A. phalloides differs from A. subjunquillea in its robust basidioma and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basid- iospores (8.0鈥10.5 9 6.5鈥9.0 lm, Q = 1.1鈥1.29, Qm = 1.19 卤 0.06) (Gilbert 1940, 1941a; Thiers 1982; Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study).

It is associated with broad-leaved forests.\\nPhylogenetically, A. brunneostrobilipes clustered as a distinct clade in A. sect. Roanokenses, away from other species (Fig. 1b). Amanita brunneostrobilipes is similar to\\nA. timida Corner & Bas, a species described from Singa- pore, in the color of the basidioma and recurved squamules on the stipe base. However, the latter can be distinguished by its white pileus with a pinkish tinge, broad ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 5.5鈥7.0 lm) and the common presence of clamps (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita brunneostrobilipes is comparable to A. stro- bilipes Thongbai et al. Bin in that they share a strobiliform basal bulb.

It is characterized by its gray pileus covered with pyramidal volval remnants, a distinctly radicating stipe base with its upper part covered with inconspicuous volval remnants, ellipsoid basidiospores (8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), the pres- ence of clamps and occurrence in temperate forests.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), A. miculifera was recognized as two phylogenetic species (HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425) based on PTP analy- sis. Because only subtle morphological differences were observed between HKAS 100515 and HKAS 101425 (ba- sidiospores   for   HKAS   100515   are   [150/3/1] 8.5鈥11.0  9 5.5鈥7.0 lm,  Q =  1.3鈥1.7,   Qm  = 1.5 卤 0.09;\\nbasidiospores  for  HKAS  101425  are  [20/1/1]   8.0鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm, Q = 1.32鈥1.6, Qm = 1.47 卤 0.08),\\nwe treat them as a single species, A. miculifera, which is also supported by GCPSR analysis (Fig. 2).\\nOur ITS phylogenetic analysis (Fig. S12) indicates that\\nA. miculifera is closely related to A. cf. vestita. However, a specimen of A. cf. vestita (HKAS 80175) listed under A. vestita, has a non-radicating basal bulb and no clamps.\\n \\nAmanita miculifera can be confused with A. onusta (Howe) Sacc., but the latter differs in its relatively larger and darker colored pyramids on the pileus, dark gray to brownish gray, warted or recurred volval remnants on the stipe base often arranged in rings, and a less prominently radicating stipe base (Bas 1969; Bas and Hatanaka 1984; Jenkins 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAmanita japonica is morphologically similar to A. miculifera in its gray pileus, a more or less radicating stipe base and ellipsoid to elongate basidiospores. However, A. japonica has pyramidal to floccose volval remnants on the pileus and a napiform stipe base slightly radicating, lacking distinct pesudorhiza (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014).

This species was initially treated as a lethal amanita of A. sect. Phalloideae (Yang and Doi 1999; Yang and Li 2001; Yang 2005). However, phylogenetic evidence, coupled with the absence of amatoxins and phallotoxins, and its fresh basidioma lacking a yellow reaction to 5% KOH solution suggested it belonged to A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (Cai et al. 2014). Amanita oberwinklerana is poisonous and can cause acute renal failure (Fu et al. 2017).\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2), spec- imens labeled as A. oberwinkerana split into two closely related subclades (the HKAS 80150 subclade and the HKAS 100611 subclade) based on GCPSR analysis. However, no distinct and stable morphological differences were found to exist between the specimens in these two subclades. Thus, we treat them as a single species, A. oberwinkerana. Ecologically, species from the HKAS 80150 clade are found in central, eastern, southern and southeastern China, while those from the HKAS 100611 clade are mainly found in central and northeastern China. These two subclades may represent different geographic populations of A. oberwinkerana. Its phylogenetically related species are as yet unknown (Fig. 1b). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line draw- ings and images of A. oberwinklerana see Yang and Doi (1999), Yang and Li (2001), and Yang (2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

Amanita pannosa is similar to A. gymnopus in appearance. However, A. gymnopus differs from A. pannosa in its broadly clavate to subglobose, often glabrous, basal bulb, and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (6.0鈥8.5 9 5.5鈥7.5 lm) (Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Hongo 1974a; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; Lee 2017).\\nAmanita luteofolia, a novel species described in this study, is also comparable to A. pannosa. However, A. luteofolia has verrucose, felted to floccose, cameo brown to brown volval remnants on the pileus, a white to dirty white stipe covered with concolorous squamules, a dirty white basal bulb covered with felty to pulverulent, cameo brown to brown volval remnants and relatively larger basid- iospores (9.5鈥12.0 9 6.5鈥8.5 lm, Q = 1.33鈥1.58, Qm =\\n1.45 卤 0.09).\\nAmanita ochrophylla, a species described from Aus- tralia, looks like A. pannosa. However, A. ochrophylla has broadly conical to shapelessly warted, non-removable volval remnants on the pileus and a second ring inside the upper annulus or on the middle or lower part of the stipe (Bas 1969; Reid 1980; Wood 1997).\\n \\n\\n \\n']\n",

It grows in subalpine forests under trees of the genera Picea and Abies.\\nIn our phylogenetic analysis (Figs. 1b, S12), A. pyra- midata is related to A. rubiginosa Cai et al., A. avel- laneifolia Yang et al. and A. magniverrucata Thiers & Ammirati. However, A. rubiginosa has a basal bulb often with a reddish tinge, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid- iospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.5鈥8,  Q = 1.15  鈥1.43,  Qm = 1.29\\n卤 0.72) and forms associations with Castanopsis, Litho- carpus, Quercus and Pinus. Amanita avellaneifolia has a dirty white to cream pileus with granular to conical volval remnants, biscuit colored lamellae, and forms association with Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis. Amanita magniver- rucata has a slender basidioma, a relatively pale pileus, volval remnants on the pileus that are at first a thick and rather smooth covering over the entire pileus, becoming areolate and later appearing as larger conspicuous pyra- midal warts, and relatively narrower basidiospores (8.0鈥12.6  9 5.8鈥8.0  lm)   (Thiers   and   Ammirati 1982;\\nTulloss 2009).\\nThe size and form of basidiospores of A. pyramidata is comparable to A. berkeleyi and A. eriophora (Berk.) E.\\nJ. Gilbert, both described from India (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar     et al. 1990). However, clamps are absent in the two Indian species (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990). Furthermore, A. berkeleyi develops a gray to gray-brown pileus bearing felted-pulverulent, crust-like volval remnants (Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990), while A. eriophora possesses a stipe covered with grayish lilac, floccose-felted volval remnants (Berkeley 1850; Gilbert 1941a; Corner and Bas 1962; Bas 1969; Kumar et al. 1990).\\n']\n",

However, the latter can be easily distinguished by its dirty white to cream pileus covered with small granular to conical, dirty white to grayish white squamules and biscuit to flesh-colored lamellae.\\n \\n\\n \\nAmanita rubiginosa is similar to A. japonica in its medium-sized basidioma, and gray pileus densely covered with grayish truncate-pyramidal verrucose to subconical squamules. However, A. japonica possesses a fusiform- rooting to subclavate basal bulb covered with floccose- pulverulent volval remnants, a non-gelatinized pileipellis and relatively narrower basidiospores (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo 1987; Li and Cai 2014).\\nAmanita rubiginosa resembles A. heishidingensis in appearance (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015). However, A. heishidingensis has a relatively larger and paler (dirty white to whitish) basidioma, and a subclavate to ventricose basal bulb covered with pale yellow to pale brownish gray, subfelty to subtomentose volval remnants (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015). In addition, A. heishidingensis occurs in the early spring, while A. rubiginosa grows in summer and autumn (Li and Cai 2014; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita griseoverrucosa Zhu L. Yang was originally placed in A. sect. Lepidella sensu Bas (1969) based on morphological studies (Yang 2004, 2005, 2015), and is allocated to A. sect. Strobiliformes in this study. It is comparable to A. rubiginosa, however, A. griseoverrucosa can be distinguished from A. rubiginosa by its white to grayish basal bulb covered with gray, grayish to whitish, verrucose or irregular formed volval remnants, and the absence of clamps (Yang 1997, 2004, 2005, 2015; see below).\\n']\n",

Furthermore, the apical part of the warts on the pileus of A. sphaerobulbosa has many vascular hyphae and inflated cells, which is not the case in A. abrupta (Bas 1969; Yang and Doi 1999).\\nAmanita sphaerobulbosa is comparable to A. kotohi- raensis, but the latter has felted to patch-like volval rem- nants on the pileus composed of irregularly arranged elements, a fragile and fugacious annulus, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (7.5鈥9.5 9 5.0鈥6.5 lm), and a pungent odor (Nagasawa and Mitani 2000; Chen et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015).

How- ever, A. cinereovelata is found in Shorea forests and differs from A. vestita in its globose to subglobose basidiospores (9.0鈥10.0 9 8.0鈥9.0 lm) and the presence of clamps (Hosen et al. 2015). Amanita griseofarinosa has a relatively larger basidioma and  broader  basidiospores  (8.0鈥10.0 9 6.0鈥9.5 lm) (Bas 1969; Imazeki and Hongo\\n1987; Yang 1997, 2005, 2015; Yang and Doi 1999; Ima- zeki et al. 2011).\\nMorphologically, A. vestita is very similar to A. cf. vestita.

It is noteworthy that the color of A. citrinoannulata is variable, ranging from yellowish, brownish, brown, grayish brown to dark brown.\\nPhylogenetically, A. citrinoannulata is closely related and morphologically similar to the European species A. spissa (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Fig. 1b). However, A. spissa differs from A. citrinoannulata in its robust basidioma, a gray pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking snakeskin-like, yellow squamules, white to dirty white volval remnants on the stipe base and a white annulus (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015). Furthermore, the reddish discoloration following bruising of A. spissa only occurs on the stipe surface, while in A. citrinoannulata the discoloration can occur over all\\n \\n\\n \\nparts of the basidioma (Konrad and Maublanc 1924; Joly 1967; Contu 2000a; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2015).\\nAmanita rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J.\\nE. Lange and A. flavorubens (Berk. & Mont.) Sacc. are morphologically similar to A. citrinoannulata in that they share basidiomata with red discoloration on bruising, and yellow annuli. However, A. rubescens f. annulosulphurea (Gillet) J. E. Lange has a grayish brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a white to dirty white stipe lacking yel- low, snakeskin-like squamules, and an inflated basal bulb glabrous or covered with dirty white, grayish to brown volval remnants (Contu 2000a; Neville and Poumarat 2004). Amanita flavorubens has a brown to yellow pileus covered with patchy, lemon yellow volval remnants and relatively longer basidiospores (9.4鈥10.2 9 6.2鈥7.0 lm) (Atkinson 1902; Coker 1917; Jenkins 1982, 1986; Tulloss et al. 1995).\\nAdditional species in A. sect. Validae sharing basid- iomata with more or less red discoloration when bruised include A. orsonii Ash. Kumar & T. N. Lakh., A. rubescens Pers. and A. excelsa (Fr.: Fr.) Bertillon. However, A. orsonii and A. rubescens have a brown pileus lacking an olivaceous tinge, a dirty white to grayish stipe lacking yellow squamules above the annulus, and a white annulus often with a reddish tinge (Gilbert 1940; Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss et al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Amanita excelsa, a species described from Sweden, has a robust basidioma with a red tinge only occurring at the stipe base, a white stipe lacking yellow squamules, and a white to dirty white annulus (Gilbert 1940; Joly 1967; Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Poumarat 2004).\\nBasidiomata of A. citrinoannulata with a gray-brown to gray pileus are also comparable to those of A. fritillaria Sacc. and A. spissacea S. Imai. However, the basidiomata of the latter two species do not change color when injured (Imai  1933,  1938;  Hongo  1959;  Corner  and  Bas  1962;\\nImazeki  and  Hongo  1987;  Imazeki  et  al.  1988,  2011;\\nKumar et al. 1990; Yang 2005, 2015). Furthermore, A. fritillaria has a white to dirty white stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, a basal bulb covered with conical, verrucose to floccose, blackish, dark gray to gray- brown volval remnants and a dirty white to gray annulus (Corner and Bas 1962; Kumar et al. 1990; Yang  2005, 2015; this study). Amanita spissacea possesses a dirty white to gray stipe covered with grayish to brownish squamules, pulverulent to floccose, blackish to dark gray volval remnants on the stipe base, a grayish annulus and subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (7.0鈥9.5 9 6.0鈥7.5 lm) (Imai 1933, 1938; Hongo 1959; Imazeki and\\nHongo 1987; Imazeki et al. 1988, 2011; this study).\\n \\n']\n",

Atk., a species described from the USA (Fig. 1b). However, A. flavoconia has an orange-yellow basidioma, a yellow annulus and narrower basidiospores (7.8鈥8.6 9 5.5鈥6.2 lm) (Jenkins 1982, 1986; Thiers 1982; Atkinson 1902; Tulloss et al. 1995; Tullos 2000b).\\nAmanita  detersa  is  very  similar  to  A. flavosquamosa\\nYang-Yang Cui et al., a novel species described in this\\n \\n\\n \\nstudy, and comparisons between the two taxa are summa- rized in the commentary on A. flavosquamosa.\\nThe yellow volval remnants of A. detersa are similar to those of the European A. franchetii (Boud.)

(2004), clustered within A. flavosquamosa with strong support (MLB = 100%). Therefore, we assign HKAS 38419 to A. flavosquamosa. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any species closely related to A. flavosquamosa (Fig. 1b).\\nAmanita flavosquamosa can be confused with A. detersa because of the color and form of the basidiomata, and the volval remnants on the pileus.

JAPAN. HOKKAIDO: Nopporo, altitude unknown, 10 October 1926, S. Imai (TYPE).\\nCommentary: Imai (1933) described A. sepiacea from Japan without assignment of a type. Hongo (1959) desig- nated a type for the species; it was collected by S. Imai from Nopporo, Hokkaido on 10 October 1926. We exam- ined the type and found that most basidiospores had col- lapsed, and only a few basidiospores could be measured. They were [15/1/1] 7.5鈥9.5 (鈥10.5)  9 (5.5鈥) 6.0鈥7.2 (鈥7.5)\\nlm,   Q = (1.1鈥)   1.14鈥1.4   (鈥1.45),   Qm = 1.27 卤 0.1,\\nbroadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid.\\nIn our multi-locus phylogenetic data (Fig. 2), collections labeled A. sepiacea were supported as two subclades based on GCPSR analysis. Since morphological differences between them were only subtle, we consider them to be a single species, A. sepiacea. No closely related species of A. sepiacea were detected in our current study (Fig. 1b). For detailed descriptions, comparisons with similar species, line drawings and images of A.  sepiacea  see  Yang  (1997, 2005, 2015).\\n']\n",

FRANCE: altitude and date unknown, Jian-Ping Xu 29 (HKAS 100533).\\nCommentary: Amanita spissa was treated as a synonym or infraspecific taxa under A. excelsa (Corner and Bas 1962;  Breitenbach  and  Kra篓nzlin  1995;  Neville  and  Pou- marat 2004). However, our molecular phylogenetic data indicate that these should be two distinct species, lacking a close relationship (Fig. 1b). Amanita spissa is probably widely distributed throughout Eurasia, but in China has only been found in the northeastern (Yang 2015; Fig. 2).\\nPhylogenetically, A. spissa is related to A. citrinoannu- lata (Fig. 1b), and a comparison between these two species is presented in the commentary on A. citrinoannulata. The red-color change on the stipe of A. spissa is comparable to that in A. orsonii and A. rubescens. However, in the latter two species, all parts of the basidiomata color red when\\n \\n\\n \\ninjured, and all have a lighter colored pileus (Kumar et al. 1990; Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Tulloss\\net al. 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; Yang 2005, 2015; this study). Furthermore, A. rubescens is found in Europe, India, Japan, Pakistan, and central, northern, northwestern and southwestern regions of China (Contu 2000a; Floriani 2000; Galli 2001; Neville and Poumarat 2004; this study), while A. orsonii is found in India, Japan and central, eastern and southwestern regions of China (Kumar et al. 1990; Tulloss et al. 2001; Yang 2005, 2015; this study).\\n']\n"
